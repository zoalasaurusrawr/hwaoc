Together. We will join forces and strike down
Calamity Ganon! Onward!
Take heart. We are here to help!
Ha! You really think we have time to take
a breather? Let's keep going!
I'm a busy bird, you know. But fine. I'll make an
exception and bail you out. Just this once.
Spare no effort! Together, we are unstoppable!
First, let's capture the enemy outposts and open
the way to Hyrule Castle!
We'll use the Divine Beasts to weaken that Ganon
jerk. Let's make this one to remember!
The only way we will win is if we fight together.
Each of you must lend your unique strength!
We've done it! We captured the outposts. Let's
keep this momentum and aim for Hyrule Castle.
Those Guardians are headed straight for us! We
have no choice but to meet them in battle.
Thank you for waiting. Now the Divine Beasts
are ready to launch their attack!
Let's see how you like this one, Calamity Ganon.
...Hm? What is THAT?
Whatever that thing is, it's going to block our
attacks on Calamity Ganon.
Before we attack with the Divine Beasts, we'll
have to deal with that barrier.
We must stop the enemy advance! But we also
have to address the barrier...
I shall defend the base. Everyone else, focus your
efforts on that shield!
The barrier is being created by the monsters...
We must focus our efforts on defeating them first!
Yes! The barrier should fall now...right?
Alas, the shield still stands. Although it does look
weakened, at least...
Indeed. In its weakened state, I may be able to
disperse it fully using my power.
Everyone, please defeat the last of them.
I'll handle the rest!
I should be able to disrupt the barrier from here.
All right... Now!
There are monsters everywhere! If this keeps
up, we'll be in deep trouble...
Argh! Even the Divine Beasts won't be able to
move for a while!
Everyone, we must remain calm. If we combine
our forces, we will surely be victorious.
We will defeat them again and aim for the castle.
Take out the monsters upholding the barrier!
I will draw the enemies on the plains to me.
Hear that, you all? I am your enemy!
That's the last of them. Or it would be, except...
They're back AGAIN?! This is an impossible task!
Kept you waiting, did we? How gracious of you
not to finish before we arrived.
I can't stand owing someone... Heh, especially
someone from the distant future.
Even for Zelda, this may be a challenge. I will go
now to my daughter's side.
Hellooooo?! I need reinforcements, pronto!
What an annoying creature... Link, why don't you
give the man a hand?
Sidon! Are you all right? You can step back and
let me handle this, you know.
Dearest sister! Nonsense. We shall fight together,
with courage and gusto to spare!
You survived, kid! Not that I'd expect any less
from my descendant, haha.
Hee-hee, thanks! It's all because of the great
ability I inherited from you. Let's keep it up, goro!
You've got spunkI'll give you that much.
Maybe I didn't need to bail you out after all.
Ha! Do not sell yourself short, Master Revali.
I am merely following your lead.
You did very well, Riju! Never underestimate a
Gerudo vai!
Lady Urbosa... Thank you for your help. With you
on my side, no enemy will stand a chance!
Zelda, always protecting others. Allow me to
protect you now.
Father! To fight by your sidethere is no
greater honor.
Offensive positions! We must break through to
the castle!
We will march forward and strike down
Calamity Ganon!
If I fall here, the fate of Hyrule... Of...everyone...
Apologies, Zelda... I have lost the kingdom you
were meant to inherit.
Here? On the cusp of victory? Father... Sidon...
I am sorry...
ARGH! How could it be over...
Gah, this is unforgivable. This glorious flight
is going down in flames...
So I am finished. Haha... Ha... Agh... Do me a favor
and look away, will you?
I've failed to help my sister yet again...
I never thought it would end like this.
Ugh... I can't go on. Forgive me, Great Daruk.
My soaring days are over. Good luck to the rest
of you...
I had such grand ambitions... Must they all end
here now?
We must first run through the enemies on the
front lines to open the path to the castle.
Now we can engage their vanguard. Let us press
on to Hyrule Castle!
Enemies? Here of all places? Well. We have no
choice but to engage them in battle.
We must address the barrier before we begin our
assault with the Divine Beasts.
Oh no! We must stop them! And we still need to
do something about the barrier too...
I shall defend the stronghold. Everyone else, try
to take down that obstruction!
I shall defend the stronghold. Everyone else, focus
on dissipating that barrier!
I will try to help take down the obstruction.
Soldiers, defend the stronghold!
I will attempt to help dissipate the barrier.
Soldiers, defend the stronghold!
The monsters seem to be creating the barrier. If
we defeat them, perhaps the barrier will fall.
All right! That should take care of the barrier!
The monsters are gone, but the barrier remains.
It does seem weakened, however.
I believe we can interrupt the barrier from here!
We must stand strong. If we band together,
we will succeed!
Defeat the enemies once more, and head to the
castle! Engage the monsters holding the barrier!
I will draw their ire. Come to me! I am your enemy!
Link! You cannot perish here... You must not!
Nobody defeats the great Master Kohga...
Urgh...
Link?! But we cannot lose you!
We lost?! This must be somebody else's fault!
