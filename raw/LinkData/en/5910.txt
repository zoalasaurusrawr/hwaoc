Great work! Knew I was right about you.
A Goron's gut is never wrong.
MORE monsters?! Persistent little beasties,
aren't they?
The big one's ready to play! Too bad for you that
NO ONE runs wild on Goron City while I'm here.
Seeing all those tasty rocks everywhere is makin'
my stomach rumble... After this, it's time to feast!
Let's do this thing! Smash 'em to bits!
Would ya look at that!
Graah! Nobody told us it would be like this!
Argh! More monsters showed up!
Send reinforcements!
Phew! I thought that was the end of the road
for me...
Whew, I'm pooped! Is that the last of 'em?
