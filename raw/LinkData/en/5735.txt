Now, Link. Show me what you're made of!
I believe in you, my friend! The power you seek
is within!
Now then, time for a rain of arrows!
Hm. So you've got a tiny bit of skill then.
I suppose I'll take you down myself!
I knew you could do it, Link!
Now, let us settle this!
Hmph. We'll call it a day. But next time...
You'll have no hope of victory.
Ahaha! Amazing as always, my friend.
Your dominance was undeniable!
Link! You're amazing! Really and truly exceptional!
Let us duel, my friend! I relish the chance!
I still cannot best you, my friend! Ah, but at
least it was fun.
So that's what you're capable of... Hmph.
I'd better step up my game.
Hmph. You're not to be overlooked, are you?
Next time, things will go differently.
Impressive. But that's not all you've got, is it?
