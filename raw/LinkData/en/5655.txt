Remember, the princess is our target. Don't waste
your energy on the others.
Link, take care of the princess. We will do what
we can here.
I'll roll away our enemies like the tiny stones they
are. Look after the princess, little guy!
You can just sit back and watch. I'll make quick
work of our foes.
Keep an eye on the princess. I will handle
the Yiga.
Everyone, please be careful.
Didn't expect things to get rough so quickly. This
is primo training, isn't it, Mipha?
You may be right, Darukthough training is not
my main concern right now...
The enemy shows no sign of relenting. Perhaps
we should ask for assistance at the garrison.
With these numbers, we can't defend the gates.
Hate to say it, but there's not much we can do...
Nowe cannot ignore the monsters overrunning
the town. Perhaps we should split up.
Enemies have taken the garrison. If we liberate it,
we can ask the soldiers inside for help.
I can tend to your wounds. In turn, will you lend us
a hand?
Yes. With your grace, we're fighting fit once more.
Hylians, to battlefor Princess Zelda!
We got backup, but so did the monsters. I suspect
the Yiga Clan is calling the shots.
Let's seal up the gates while we still can.
We can't let any more enemies into town!
Our backup can look out for the central gate.
Let's head for the other places.
Yes. But by spreading out across the battlefield,
we can turn the tide in our favor.
Helllllp! With the monsters here, we can't close
the gate!
Stand firm! If we're gonna stop the enemy from
pushin' past us, we'll need all the help we can get!
All right! We'll put our backs into it, then!
I would call that a success.
Heh. That's what happens when you mess
with ME.
Well done.
Good work! Let's keep it up.
You live up to your reputation, Daruk. Now it falls
to me to match you!
Whoa! You're somethin' else, Mipha.
I'll have to step it up too, hahaha!
Just one remaining!
All righty! Just one spot left.
Only one remains. Leave it to me.
Report! The enemy leader has been spotted at the
northern outpost!
Great! Then it's time to turn the tables!
We cannot charge headlong toward the outpost.
There are bound to be traps.
We should strike from the eastern and western
outposts. A pincer attack should do the trick.
Hey, what's with all the hubbub?!
Unbelievable. Looks like they got confused and
ran out. Now we can attack their stronghold.
Wait a minute! No one said anything about a
pesky Hinox!
We don't have time for this nonsense.
Then again, if it heads to town...
We can't let that happen. We must defeat
this beast, here and now!
Now that that's over withwhere is the
Yiga leader?
Fire! Scattered across the town!
Those four certainly have impressive skills. But it
matters not. They won't make it in time.
I will have your lives!
Link!
Can't believe we fell for it. He lured us away with
phony info!
At least Link is with the princess. He will keep
her safe.
Well, aren't you persistent. Perhaps our strategy
should have focused more on you...
What a blunder...
We will guard this place with our lives! You will
not harm the princess!
Please, help us! They're going to break through!
We can't withstand much more of this. Quickly,
send help!
I'll be taking your life now!
No... The princess is...
Princess Zelda... Link... I am sorry.
No! We messed up big this time...
I can't believe this! I shouldn't have held back...
Link, take the princess and gonow!
Something's not right... You're not Hylian soldiers!
The Yiga have infiltrated an outpost? This game
of false faces wears on my patience.
There are enemies in the garrison? We must hurry!
We're saved! Now we can help the princess too!
Argh! They're coming at us from everywhere
at once!
I couldn't do anything at all... I'm so sorry...
Link! Oh no... It's all my fault...
We have located the enemy commander!
He's holed up over there!
I recommend against a direct attack. They may be
preparing to ambush us.
Then we attack from both sides. If we can
manage it, we'll secure the upper hand. Easy.
To fall here? To fall so short...
