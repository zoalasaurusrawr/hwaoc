We were supposed to investigate the ruins here...
But the monsters. Well then, let's eradicate them!
There are more of them than I thought. Still, we
must press on!
And here too! We'll have to show just how
resilient we truly are.
We made it through, despite the challenges. Now
then, let's begin investigating the ruins!
I, too, will perform my sworn duty!
We must not hesitate. We must strikenow!
This can't be!
What a relief!
The path is clearonward!
I refuse to be burdensome. I withdraw for now.
I have to pull out for now. I will pray for
your safety.
I exert my will!
Well done! Our victory is certain.
I don't understand... Clearly I need more power.
Wonderful!
Oh no! Just when we thought we'd arrived,
another monster shows up?!
More foul beasts?! Gah! We mustn't falter!
Hold strong!
Gah! We can't hold out any longer!
We must hurry to their aid at once!
Our allies are fighting for their lives. We must
rush to their aid.
Do not give up! We are on our way!
It took time and perseverance, but we did it. Now
then, let's proceed with the investigation!
