Everyone...chaaarge!
No, no, no!
I'm sorry, but we must retreat!
We're not going down that easy!
That's Link for you. His talent knows no bounds!
Whoa. We knew you were good, but we didn't
know you were THAT good.
We're ready for the fight!
Gah! It's too strong!
Spectacular! How did you pull that off?!
I am not fooled by your size. I will hold
nothing back!
Oh ho ho! A mighty king losing to a little whelp of
a Guardian! How very humbling.
All right! We'll put our backs into it, then!
Ugh... You seem strong!
But I won't back down!
You truly are excellent, Link...!
But I won't lose to you next time!
