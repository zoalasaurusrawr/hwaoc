The Gorons are doing their best, but I think they
could use a little help.
Thanks for lendin' a hand! Oh, wait a tick...
Yunobo's not with you?
He is not. I hope that big pebble is all right.
Lady Urbosa! Please, help!
Worry not! I am here to protect you.
Thank you, Lady Urbosa! From now on, I'm gonna
stick right by you!
Ha, I have taken a shine to you as well. You are
cut from good granite, just like Daruk!
