Shokie-dokie! I'll show you the way to
Korok Forest!
Yeeeeek! Monsterrrrs! Hellllp!
Hestu's in danger! Quickly, we have to help him!
Actually, you can pass through here!
Such a strange place for a pathway. Without a
guide, we'd never have seen it.
You can also pass through here! But nowhere
else! Watch your step!
I can hardly discern anything through the fog.
I can't make sense of this, but I can tell you've
got a real knack for it.
The Korok Forest is just ahead! This has been
a breeze, thanks to you all!
An ill wind stirs... Hopefully I'm imagining things.
It can't be as simple as a stroll through the
woods. On your guard, everyone.
Wahhh, scary giant monster!
If we make it past here, we'll be in
Korok Forest! Shaka!
This is the entrance, but, hey... Who put all this
weird mud here? Now we can't get through!
It might be the work of the Yiga Clan...
Maybe if we look around, we'll figure out how
to get rid of that stuff!
Shaka. I'm kinda scared, but if it's for the forest,
I'll do my part!
What is that thing? Some kind of twisted illusion?
Shaka! It looks kinda like that mud we saw
at the entrance!
The two certainly must be related. Either way,
watch outit's on the attack!
Shalaka! Some of the mud is gone! Let's
keep going!
They have defeated the Hollows, hm? No matter.
I will simply raise more.
How can I beat back my own shadow?
Hey, you! Don't go ruinin' my good name,
you hear?!
Hm. He didn't just steal my good looks, but also
my unparalleled talents. The nerve of this guy!
A fight against myself, hm? Good. Might be a
decent challenge.
Rise again! Keep them away from that
accursed blade!
They're...back? I can't believe we have to fight
them again.
The path to Korok Forest is clear! Link, come!
We'll keep them at bay! Hurry on, friends!
Nothey have pulled the sword free! I will not
let them abscond with it alive!
I will end you myself, you nuisance!
That sword... It is too powerful...
Shakala... I just wanted to go home... Back to
Korok Forest...
You vermin, how dare you destroy my handiwork?
Monsters, go forth! Protect the remaining Hollows!
You vermin, how dare you destroy my handiwork?
Minions, protect the remaining Hollows!
