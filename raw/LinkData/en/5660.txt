Report! The Yiga Clan stormed Akkala Citadel
they have already captured it!
To reach that tower, we'll have to retake
the citadel!
Right on cue, the army of Hyrule has arrived.
Yiga, annihilate them!
They've blocked the bridge. Well played, Yiga.
This place used to have a research lab. Look
the Guardians they were studying are still here.
If we can activate a Guardian with the little one,
we may be able to clear the path.
Ah, there's a Guardian being researched over
there too. If we activate it, it'll be valuable for us.
All right. Ready, little one?
Acknowledged.
Activating Guardian.
Removal of obstacle - complete.
Wonderful!
Another blocked bridge. Can you manage this one
too, little knight?
The little one is tapped out for now. Perhaps we
can use an ancient furnace to provide power...
Let's use the ancient furnace to supplement the
little one's energy.
The way is clear. On we go.
It seems unwise to leave these odd
relics unattended.
Everyone, you know what to do.
The Yiga Clan is in our way, but not for long.
Scorching sands! The gates will not open!
They excel at slowing us down.
I recall a Guardian within the citadel. If we
activate it, it could break the gate from within.
I imagine that would require even more energy.
Now is the time. Destroy the relic!
No! The furnace! Without its energy, we can't...
Oh no... We needed that energy...
Come on. Just a bit more. Let's head for the
remaining furnaces.
This will not be a simple task for you. No, no.
No! We cannot let them destroy them!
But...how can this be?
We've done it! We have enough energy now. Let's
activate the Guardian within the citadel.
I don't know if this will suffice, but we must try.
We clearly don't have enough energy, but we
have no choice but to try.
Quickly!
That Guardian's on a rampage! Run awaaaay!
My warriors! What are you doing?
Now! Into the citadel!
We cannot leave the Guardian rampaging
like that...
It's a pitiable thing we've done, isn't it...
All that's left is to chase the Yiga Clan out.
Let's defeat their ringleader!
There is no alternative now.
You must face me.
I see you have some skill. Well, then.
Where could he have gone? We must search
within the citadel.
Ah-HA!
Agh! Where did he come from?!
Hm. You're quite good. Perhaps next time, then.
He disappeared again. He's got to be around here.
Leave no stone unturned!
All of you, attack! We must undo their forces!
The Yiga Clan is relentless! Please, be careful!
We've done what we could. Time to retreat.
Finally, he turned tail. Now we can restore
the tower.
Yes. With this, all the towers will be restored.
It will serve us well in facing the Calamity.
Link, you've done enough. Let's withdraw for now.
I can go no further... I'm so sorry...
Guh... Even I have my limits. Apologies, but I have
to pull back.
They have beaten us this time. We can go
no further.
If we could start up the Guardians with the little
one's power, we may be able to open the way.
We have come all this way. Those who stand
against us will meet a swift end.
What a relief!
The path is clearonward!
