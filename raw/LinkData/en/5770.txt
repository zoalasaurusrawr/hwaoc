We were THIS CLOSE to a nice, long soak in
the hot springs. You'll pay for this!
Everyone's feeling unnerved... But I suppose
that's to be expected.
We came all the way to Death Mountain for this.
None who stand in our way will survive!
Everyone's riled up about the hot springs...
I must speak to Buliara about this when I'm back.
We have come all this way. Those who stand
against us will meet a swift end.
We came all this way just to encounter monsters?
We had better prepare ourselves!
Everyone showed such tremendous spirit. I will
tell Buliara all about it when I return.
