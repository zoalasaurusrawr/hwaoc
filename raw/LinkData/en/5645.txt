We must eliminate the monsters advancing on
the region. Soldiers, to battle!
Their numbers are staggering... Does this portend
that the Calamity draws near?
He took out ALL of those monsters... Wow!
That young knight is something else!
More foul beasts?! Gah! We mustn't falter!
Hold strong!
OK! The outpost is taken! But that power...
These foes are strong. Stay on your guard!
The enemy's attacks are fierce... Try deflecting
them and looking for an opening to counterattack!
Well, well! We have a Moblin slayer among us.
Your Majesty! The princess's aide has been
sighted on the battlefield!
Give the word and we can escort her to safety.
No need. She is more than capable of
handling herself.
Great job! Let's use this momentum to take
back the outpost.
We'll head south and deal with the monsters on
that side!
What is THAT? But no, first I must
deal with these enemies.
You therethanks for the help.
Now, let's carve our way out.
And now what's that?! The Sheikah
Slate in your hands...
It's been activated! Purah said the slate
might have powers to help our fight!
It appears to be an outpost that the
monsters built...
Bomb barrels... We must be careful. If jostled,
they'll explode.
Remarkable. That knight has taken outpost after
outpost on the western front.
A fearsome monster has appeared. Please,
let me handle this!
Good work, Lady Impa! We'll try our best to
keep up!
Hm? That item on the ground... Perhaps an enemy
dropped it.
Argh! Stay strong! If we fall back, we're doomed...
The Hyrulean army is in trouble. I'm on my way!
Isn't that...a watering hole? Hmm...
She took down a whole SWARM! Lady Impa
is incredible!
This area should be secure now, but we mustn't
let our guard down. Let's move!
R-report! New monsters have appeared!
They're heading north!
If we don't defeat them here, they may rally their
forces. We must stop this new threat at once!
The tide of battle has been decided. Let's finish
this in one fell swoop.
It's bad. Real bad! A troop of Moblins
has appeared!
That IS bad. But somehow, we must find a way to
stop them.
Some pesky monsters have showed their ugly
faces again. Let's stay on our guard.
Hm. If we defeat that monster, he may drop
another weapon...
Look! We did it! The monsters are retreating!
You fought well, and victory is your reward.
Savor it!
That young knight served his kingdom well.
Perhaps an official appointment is in order...
They broke past the stronghold? That means
Hyrule Castle is next. My people are in danger!
I was busy aiding the princess...
Please, forgive me.
Fire the cannonsnow! Blast those
monsters off the plain!
Shut the gate! Prevent their retreat!
We've got them now! FIRE!
It seems we have purged the horde from
the castle. Well fought, all!
Knights, keep the throng at bay while we reload
the cannons!
Your Majesty, report from our forces to the west!
A giant tower of some kind has appeared.
Yes... I see it too. Send soldiers to investigate
the site.
