Say a prayer, Yiga. Urbosa is coming.
Attacking from the watchtowers? How irritating.
Now, they die.
Is that...a Molduga?!
It must have been drawn to all the noise.
Best not to linger.
Well done, Vah Naboris! For my part, I am finally
getting used to these controls.
Hmm. Electrical attacks may prove ineffective.
It seems we cannot land a hit when the creature
is beneath the sand.
Perhaps if we strike at the exact moment it
breaches the surface...
This is our chance. Let's charge and then smash
our way through!
That did the trick! Now, let us press on!
I...failed. Perhaps I was not a worthy Divine Beast
pilot after all.
Quite a pair we make. Now, to show them the will
of the Gerudo!
You have stirred up a tempest, now suffer
the lightning!
The Guardians are swarming. It seems they
recognize Vah Naboris as a threat.
Guh... With enemies in these numbers, even
Vah Naboris may not survive unscathed.
We cannot afford to get bogged down. Too much
is at stake!
No! I fear we are too late.
Nonsense! I have never felt more certain that the
Gerudo will thrive after I am gone.
Naboris is named after an ancient sage...and just
like the sage, it helps us fight Calamity Ganon.
We seem to have cleaned up here. Now we press
our advantage!
Go forth, Vah Naboris. We will rend them
to pieces.
The princess is giving all she has. I owe it to her
to do the same.
Moving at a good clip, Vah Naboris. Keep it up!
Riju, it seems Vah Naboris has taken a shine
to you.
You dare stand against us? Vah Naboris and I will
punish your arrogance!
Guh. They are not letting up. Be strong,
Vah Naboris.
My turn. Now, witness the spirit of the Gerudo!
A pack of Guardians against two Gerudo vai?
I like our chances. Come on!
OK! Though I lack your experience, I swear to
do my best to help!
Lady Urbosa, it's terrible! A group of Guardians
is heading to Fort Hateno...
No. They must not be allowed to spread beyond
Hyrule Field.
Come on! These contraptions will not let up,
so neither can we!
Right! We'll do whatever is necessary to
stop them!
That is most of the ones headed for Fort Hateno
dealt with. You are a powerful ally, Riju!
I hope one day I can ascend to your heights,
Lady Urbosa!
I will never stop trying to keep up with you.
As your successor, I must not fail!
The Guardians are swarming. It seems they
recognize Vah Naboris as a threat.
Oh no... There are countless Guardians. Are they
all really taking aim at us?
You are far from alone, remember. If we persist,
a path will open.
Lady Urbosa... You are a treasure.
Brilliant, Riju! One last push!
We did it! We really did it!
Yes. Marvelously done, Riju. You showed true
courage today.
Oh! Only because I had your help, Lady Urbosa.
Now let's go take out the remaining Guardians!
Guh... With enemies in these numbers, even
Vah Naboris may not survive unscathed.
I will support you until the very end, Lady Urbosa.
Let's have at it!
Even Vah Naboris has reached its limit...
Nowe have not lost yet. Take my hand.
Keep your gaze on the present moment.
I am sorry, Riju. I let you down. I let myself down.
Vah Naboris... Lady Urbosa...
Please, no.
We cannot afford to get bogged down. Too much
is at stake!
There isn't much time. We have to defeat as
many Guardians as we can!
Guardians as far as the eye can see...
What now, Lady Urbosa?
Courage, Riju... I will keep you alive, no matter
what it costs me.
No! I fear we are too late.
Since throwing myself into this conflict, I've
battled with my lack of experience...
Nonsense! I have never felt more certain that the
Gerudo will thrive after I am gone.
Long ago, my mother would tell me stories about
Vah Naboris as a guardian deity of the Gerudo...
Naboris is named after an ancient sage...and just
like the sage, it helps us fight Calamity Ganon.
We seem to have cleaned up here. Now we press
our advantage!
Yes, Lady Urbosa!
Guh... It's not over just yet...
I'm afraid I cannot carry on alone.
At last, a feat worthy of Lady Urbosa and
my noble ancestors!
I'm sorry for the wait. My strength is yours!
The timing is perfect. Let's begin!
No... I will not allow you to push past!
What just transpired?!
Excellent work. Keep it up!
Let's see the fruits of our labor. Now!
Ah, finally. We may pass.
Patricia and I stand between you and your goal!
I refuse to fall here. Please...keep fighting in
my stead.
I will not be a burden on you, so I must retreat.
I will not fail. Gerudo pride is at stake!
Victory! Great work, all. And you too, Patricia.
My force of will...was not strong enough this time.
Onward, Patricia! They need our help!
I am Riju, chieftain of the Gerudo. And this is
Patricia, my noble steed.
Well, well... They're putting up a better fight than
I anticipated.
Urgh... I could use some backup right about now.
I fight for the glory of the Gerudo.
Rest assured, I will take it from here.
Strike like a flash of lightning!
You want to take this ground? Come on, then!
Fight for it!
Ah! I was not expecting this...
We have a good rhythm going!
Ready? Let's begin.
I see an opportunity to advance. Let's seize it!
You will go no furthernot while I'm here.
We must survive this battle to face the next.
As much as it pains me, I have to fall back.
I know when I've been bested. Time to bow out.
A Gerudo warrior does not give in!
Victory smiles upon us! Feels pretty good, no?
This, it seems, is the end of the road.
I'll be there soon. Try not to die in the meantime.
I am Urbosa, chief of the Gerudo!
