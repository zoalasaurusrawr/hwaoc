Fort Hateno is an inch away from falling. There
isn't a moment to lose.
Princess... The way forward is too dangerous.
Please, try to avoid doing anything reckless.
I am going. You cannot stop me. Now then, we
must aid the soldiers who are in trouble!
Gah! We can't take much more of this!
Do not give up! We are on our way!
For the time being, we've removed the enemies.
Quickly, let's see to the soldiers' wounds.
No... Please, don't worry about us. The outpost at
the center of the plain needs your help.
I understand. I'll head there immediately.
Just as the reports said, this is a challenging
situation.
Princess?! This outpost is doomedplease, make
your escape before it's too late!
Never. I will do my partno matter the cost.
An explosion! Was that the Guardian from before?
It sounds like Fort Hateno is in grave danger.
Oh no... I must be swift.
A horde of Guardians is headed this way!
Guardians... So many...
Stand down, Princess! I beg of you!
Quickly! We must hurry and save those within
the fort!
I... I...
That light, it looks like... No! NO!
Awaken, Blight Ganons! Consign that wretched
princess to oblivion!
The monsters are in pain... Princess?
Could it be?
We must strike now! Don't allow them to regroup.
It's time to eradicate them from Hyrule!
Ahahaaa! That was tip-top, Princess! You gave it
110 percent, didn't ya?
Purah! You're all right!
The surge is not over yet. More Guardians are
headed this way!
Hehe! As it happens, I'm prepared to get us out of
exactly this pickle. Folks, LISTEN UP!
Those outposts crawling with monsters? I need ya
to take 'em back and secure the devices there.
Understood. We'll recapture the outposts.
Everyone, let's divide and conquer!
That power... Princess, I knew you could do it!
Yes, I'm fine. I've worried you, haven't I?
Good going! Now that that's done and dusted,
you can activate the device!
Yup, that's it! Also, we don't have any spares,
so be veeery gentle...
The monsters are out in force. Let's be on guard
so that Fort Hateno does not fall!
That there's a modified Guidance Stone, capable
of amplifying ancient energy from the ground.
It's for my research, but if we use it wrong in
juuust the right way, we'll overload their systems!
Report! Multiple Guardians making their approach
from Dueling Peaks!
Leave the Guardians to me. Focus on recapturing
the outposts and on defense.
Even with Vah Naboris's feint, there are still so
many. I hope Lady Urbosa is safe.
We've successfully secured this device. Now we
just need to address the final one.
Restoring the Guardians to normal is another
matter, but for now, this'll at least knock 'em out.
I based the device off tech inside your tiny
automaton. Remember, it's a one-time-only gambit.
Purah, we've completed our task. With this, the
Guardians will
They're not shutting down! Why aren't they
shutting down?! ...Hm, maybe there's interference.
Something might be jamming the devices' power
supply. I'll head for the lab and try rebooting them!
Moving alone across this battlefield is a death
sentence. Let's escort Purah!
Oh, gears and screws! Something's coming!
That monster! There must've been more...
I bet that's why my devices are on the fritz.
Hurry up and get rid of these bozos!
All right, I can keep going!
Just as I thought, they're gumming up the works!
Take 'em out so I can reboot the devices!
Aw, yeah! That's what they get for messing
around with my lab! Thanks for bustin' em!
Oh, Purah. You're always speaking nonsense.
Yeah, yeah. Put the lecture on ice, will ya?
It's time to see what my toys can do!
A smashing success! And luckily, our little buddy
here is still up and running!
Howeeeever! The effect is temporary. If you get
close to the Guardians, they'll attack, so don't!
There's no use lingering. Let's use this time
to withdraw... Hm?
Report! An unusual Guardian has appeared on the
plain, and there's nothing we can do to stop it!
I shoulda known it wouldn't be so simple. Welp,
good luck hacking and slashing, all! Purah, out!
It also showed up in Akkala Citadel...
Calamity Ganon's power at work. Even ancient
energy is no match for that malign influence...
It seems to be heading for Fort Hateno. We must
stop it before it enters the fort!
It's over, isn't it?
No. Until we can seal Calamity Ganon, there will be
no rest for us.
They're hitting us hard! Half of the defensive
perimeter is destroyed!
Anybody who can hear me...please, send help!
We're on our last legs!
The Guardians broke through our defenses.
Fort Hateno has fallen.
In other words...it's over. They'll move on to the
village, and then...
Lethal wounds confirmed.
Link will be unable to continue the battle.
I gave it my all, until the very end...
In the end, I couldn't help things...
This is as far as I go... Link, please look after
the princess in my stead...
Yowch! Back me up over here, will ya?!
Princess... Watch out for my little sis, OK?
Wow, thanks for your help!
No... Please, don't worry about us. The others
need your help more than we do.
Something might be jamming the devices' power
supply. I'll try rebooting them!
This cannot be good... Someoneanyone!
Lend me your strength!
I cannot fall here. Not like this.
I wield such power?
I, too, will perform my sworn duty!
We must not hesitate. We must strikenow!
I will not stand down. I will not cede this place!
This can't be!
What a relief!
Good. Now let us act swiftly.
The path is clearonward!
Never will you pass beyond here!
I refuse to be burdensome. I withdraw for now.
I have to pull out for now. I will pray for
your safety.
I exert my will!
Well done! Our victory is certain.
I don't understand... Clearly I need more power.
We must hurry to their aid at once!
I am Zelda, princess of Hyrule!
They simply won't let up, will they?
This situation has gone from bad to worse.
I did it! Ahem... I mean, we've all done our part.
I have arrived. Now, where is our foe?
My time has come!
Even if it kills me, I will not allow you to pass!
What is the meaning of this?!
How fortuitous!
Time to execute the plan!
It's time! Let's move out!
If you wish to proceed, you must get through
me first.
I can't go on... I'm afraid I must step aside for now.
I must retreat... Yet the pain I feel is nothing
compared to this utter humiliation!
I refuse to fall here!
May this victory carve a path to a
better tomorrow!
This cannot be... I have failed us all.
I'm on my way. Please, hold strong!
I am Impa, royal advisor of Hyrule.
Argh! Somebody, help!
It's no use! We're goners, aren't we?!
We're here, and we're ready to fight!
Everyone...chaaarge!
Hold your positions!
No, no, no!
Good! Let's keep it up!
Now, do it just as we planned!
We have a clear path forward. Come on!
You're not going one step farther!
I'm sorry, but we must retreat!
Much more of this and we're done for.
We have to fall back and regroup!
We're not going down that easy!
Hang on! We'll be there soon!
