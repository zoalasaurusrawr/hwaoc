Uh, whoops. My Guardian control experiment was
a failure. Well, no need to point fingers, heh heh!
Purah! This is no time for levity. We must stop
them at once!
Phew, you saved my bacon! Thanks for always
being there to clean up my messes, little sis.
*sigh* Oh, Purah... What will I do with you?
This had better not happen again!
They simply won't let up, will they?
This situation has gone from bad to worse.
I did it! Ahem... I mean, we've all done our part.
I have arrived. Now, where is our foe?
My time has come!
Even if it kills me, I will not allow you to pass!
What is the meaning of this?!
How fortuitous!
Time to execute the plan!
It's time! Let's move out!
If you wish to proceed, you must get through
me first.
I can't go on... I'm afraid I must step aside for now.
I must retreat... Yet the pain I feel is nothing
compared to this utter humiliation!
I refuse to fall here!
May this victory carve a path to a
better tomorrow!
This cannot be... I have failed us all.
I'm on my way. Please, hold strong!
I am Impa, royal advisor of Hyrule.
Impa, you're the royal advisor! Where'd you
even learn to do that?!
