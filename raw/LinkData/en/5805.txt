Link, danger is imminent. Please request backup. 
We captains must keep the monsters
out of the domain!
I must find Sidon. As we go, I'll tend to
the wounded. Please, cover me!
We will keep you safe and fight off
these invaders too!
You're safe, for the moment!
Have you seen my brother?
Thank you, Lady Mipha! No one has found
Prince Sidon yetnot in the domain.
Where could he have wandered off to?
You have our gratitude, Lady Mipha. We will
return to our posts.
Thank you for your aid! Oh, Prince Sidon?
I believe he left the domain on his own.
Unattended? Oh no! I can only hope he has
not gone off to Ploymus Mountain again.
We were in dire straits there. Thank you for
the rescue.
Those monsters... They had weapons that could
chill our very blood to ice.
Hmm... Perhaps we can turn the tables on them
by seizing one of those weapons.
Caution, Lady Mipha! The monsters ahead
wield lightning!
No wonder our fighters are struggling!
We Zora are weak to electricity.
We are too late...but there is no time to dwell on
that failing. We must save everyone we can!
I will not allow the Zora to be wiped out!
Pleasewe cannot fail again!
Thank you, Lady Mipha. I will join in the search
for Prince Sidon.
Lady Mipha, stay away! The electrical attacks...
It is not safe for you here!
I will not let these invaders run rampant in
the domain!
Good riddance. Another step toward
restoring peace!
Our foes have outmaneuvered us! We must split
up to defeat them!
With your mending, we are ready to fulfill our
duty. You two, please capture the outpost!
More monsters armed with electricity. We should
try taking those weapons for ourselves!
My lady, Prince Sidon was spotted heading
toward Ploymus Mountain!
Not there! We have to bring him back!
Leave the domain to us while you
make haste to the prince.
Oh, Sidon. Please be all right.
You beast! I will not let you lay a finger on Sidon!
Haah...haah... The enemy...is almost beaten.
Just a few more strikes...
Link?! No! Please, no!
I thought I was strong enough to protect Sidon...
protect everyone. But I failed.
Sidon, no! How could I have let this happen?!
If we capture that freezing weapon, we might
gain the upper hand!
Lady Mipha, please! It is too dangerous!
Take heed! A horde has appeared near
the domain!
What?! This must have been their
plan this whole time!
The domain is in peril. Divide our forces!
Strike on two fronts!
