What the ever-loving heck?! Get these monsters
out of my hideout!
Master Kohga, I have dispatched the monsters
around us. Only those inside are left.
Sooga, my hero! You've earned yourself a nice,
yellow mighty banana, mister!
We have done plenty.
HA! You're not taking the Yiga Clan hideout!
Never in a hundred years!
You smell that?! A fresh batch of baddies, just
begging for a beatdown!
