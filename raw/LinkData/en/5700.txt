Everyone...chaaarge!
No, no, no!
I'm sorry, but we must retreat!
We're not going down that easy!
That's Link for you. His talent knows no bounds!
Whoa. We knew you were good, but we didn't
know you were THAT good.
We're ready for the fight!
Gah! It's too strong!
They simply won't let up, will they?
This situation has gone from bad to worse.
I have arrived. Now, where is our foe?
My time has come!
You're strong, but I refuse to back down!
Your prowess is undeniable.
Look at that. I didn't realize how powerful
you had become.
You're incredible, Link! But next time,
victory is mine.
You are beyond reproach, Princess.
As expected, Your Majesty. I have much work
still to do.
You've done a fine job, Terrako. Enough to force
me to praise a walking scrap pile.
That match was enlightening. Truly a great
learning experience.
