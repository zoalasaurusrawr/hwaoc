Guardians on a rampage near the village!
We must stop them from hurting anyone!
That seems to be all sorted out. Thank goodness
there were no casualties.
Just as I feared, the tide of battle is not in our
favor. But we must persist.
I am bent...but not broken. Even as my body
grows weak...I will stand strong!
Wonderful! I am glad to be doing my part.
Take heart. I am here to help.
This is our chance!
You shall advance no further. I will defend this
ground with my very life!
I don't believe it!
Hee-hee. We did it!
Time to carry out the plan!
Now, let us press forward!
Oh no you don't!
I am so sorry, my friends... I have failed you.
I am afraid my fight is over. Carry the torch
for me.
Everyone is counting on me! I cannot fail!
I am just glad I made it through in one piece.
I wish I could have done more.
I will be there as soon as I am able.
I am Mipha, princess of the Zora!
Hold on! I will try to rescue all of you!
