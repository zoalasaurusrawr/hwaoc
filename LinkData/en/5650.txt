Now all we've gotta do is get climbin'. Backup
should be on the way soon.
Lord Daruk! Monsters are on the attack!
Monsters?! Guessing that means our backup is
backed up. Looks like our climb's delayed.
Your fun is over, monster breath! The Great
Daruk is on the job!
One down! Keep it up!
Great work! Knew I was right about you.
A Goron's gut is never wrong.
Phew! We're saved!
More company? Fine by me! Let's split up and
drive the monsters back.
I'll be fine, but you'd better watch out. I'll take the
south, where there's a greater chance of rockfall.
Haha, good stuff! You're stronger than you look.
Oh yeaaaah! That takes care of that.
MORE monsters?! Persistent little beasties,
aren't they?
The big one's ready to play! Too bad for you that
NO ONE runs wild on Goron City while I'm here.
Nothin' to it! As long as I'm around, you'll never
mess with the Gorons.
Heh, sorry for the trouble back there. Ready to
climb this mountain already?
Hot springs! Good time to rest our weary bones.
We have a ways to go, so how about a break?
We'll have to get rid of those monsters before we
lower the bridges into the foothills.
Ha! Never thought a tiny Hylian would be strong
enough to impress the Great Daruk!
Leave the bridge to me!
Let's get to climbing Death Mountain already!
Argh! More monsters showed up!
Send reinforcements!
More monsters?! But we came all the way here.
Looks like we'll have to go back and help out.
Or how about one group defends the mine while
another charges ahead and cuts a path!
We can't keep relying on Lord Daruk to save us
all the time! Let's do our best and make him proud!
Lookit that. The gang's all here! Let's combine our
forces and punch our way through!
You were a big help, Link! You're really starting to
grow on me, haha!
You're the kinda fella I can really count on. Bet
your appetite is as mighty as your blade too!
That tears it, Link. From today, you're my go-to
little guy! I'm countin' on ya, is what I'm sayin'!
You OK there?! Looks like we'll have to pull back...
Great Daruk...defeated?! Huh! I'll have to back off
and regroup.
The mine is under attack? Looks like we'll have to
leave the Divine Beast for another day...
Whoa, there! I'm fine, but you folks had better be
careful! Maybe I should go to the south side...
Whoa, there! I'm fine, but you folks had better be
careful! Maybe I should go over to that side...
That's the stuff! While some of us defend the
outpost, the rest should cut a path forward!
Never thought the outpost would be captured by
monsters... The Divine Beast will have to wait.
Guh! Can somebody bail us out of this mess?
Good stuff! Makes me want to up my game!
