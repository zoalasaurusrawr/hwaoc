No... The Calamity. It's already begun.
Father will still be within the sanctum. Quickly!
There's not a moment to lose!
Princess! It's too dangerous! Oh, fine...
Link! Back her up!
Argh! The Guardians are coming for us!
They've gone berserk? This doesn't bode well...
Calamity Ganon has taken control of
the Guardians?!
Father must be here...
Gah! It's too strong!
The Guardians have targeted our allies!
We must help them!
More Guardians... Be careful!
What more can we possibly do?
Is this where it ends? Your Majesty...
Please be safe...
We defeated them, somehow. Now then, do you
know my father's whereabouts?
The king fled through the back entrance. We
were cut off from the others amid the chaos.
Let's exit out the back as well, then. I'm so
relieved Father is all right...
We've done it. But...where is Father?
If he's not here, he must have escaped through
the back entrance.
We must do the same, Princess. With haste.
With monsters and Guardians inside the castle,
there's no time to waste.
First through the library, and then to the great hall.
From there, we should head for the main gates.
The Guardians here aren't running rampant...yet.
We must leave before they activate!
Through that door, on to the great hall. Let us
be swift!
Another Guardian. We'll need to defeat it to
move forward.
Let's head for the great hall. From there, we
can exit through the main gates.
No! The Guardians have activated. If we don't do
something, they'll attack from both sides.
Impa, stay calm. We'll be fine. Let's advance
carefully and watch our backs.
Even more of them? Everyone, be on guard.
And here too!
Princess, the door to the main gates...
Yet another dead end... What should we do?
Other places to escape from... Ah! Perhaps the
training area?
Good idea. Onward!
Just when I thought we were about to escape...
No time for dismay, Princess. Let's defeat this
brute and find His Majesty!
We did it! Just a little farther and we're out.
Please, hurry.
We haven't the time for this. Head for the exit!
We made it, somehow. Still, I can't believe the
Guardians have turned on us...
I never imagined this would happen... We must
hurry to my father.
Link! This is all my fault... If I had only awakened
the power...
I can go no further. Father, Link, everyone.
I'm sorry...
Princess, it seems this is where I take my leave.
Link... Please, look after her...
