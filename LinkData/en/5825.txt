Gang up if ya wantit makes no difference.
You'll never get by me!
I'll let you know what the nearby enemies are
up to. You focus on fighting, Great Daruk!
Wowie! Such strength!
With you on board, our buddy here is workin' its
tail off. Makes it easy to wreck stuff up!
Yikes! The monsters are advancing!
Calm down, kid. Is there anything nearby that
could stop their momentum?
Oh! Um! How about...that pile of rocks?
If you topple it, that might slow 'em down!
Ugh... No matter how many we defeat, there's
always more.
If we stay on the defense, this'll go on forever.
Let's take out the bridges and stop 'em for good!
Great Daruk! Tons of Guardians are incoming
from the southern bridge!
Ready! Southern bridge, right? I'll head 'em off
from here!
Gah, Guardians every which way I turn! I can't
get close to the bridge like this...
Oh! There's a rock pile here too. Topple it to
stop our enemies in their tracks!
MORE Guardians?! Yeesh! Now they're coming
from the northern bridge.
From the north this time, eh? OK, kid.
I'm on my way.
Are those all monster outposts?! Bah! Oh, um...
I can see a big building to the north!
OK, it's time. Now I can smash 'em to bits!
We managed to protect it! Thanks for helpin'
me out there, Yunobo!
Oh! Heheh...I...don't know how to react to such
high praise from the Great Daruk!
Haha, calm down, little fella. Now, let's keep it up
and send that Calamity Ganon creep packing.
Gah! I guess...that's it for me.
Noooo... I came to help everyone, but I didn't end
up being useful after all, goro...
The Great Daruk is huuuuge... He must eat A LOT.
You wanna grow big like me, kid? Just fill up on
tasty rocks every chance you get!
I'll do my best! I'll eat and eat until I can't eat
any more!
Heh, I've got some enemies to play with here,
too. Time to finish this!
Yeah! OK! I'll show you how strong I am, goro!
Guh... This could be a tough rock to swallow.
Me? Cornered? What are the odds...
Aw, yeah! Plenty more where that came from!
Hrm? What's this all about?
Hahaha! That'll teach you to mess with the
mighty Daruk!
Hey! Stop right there!
Aw, yeaaah! Let's do this!
Hahaha! Score one for the Great Daruk!
I can help! Probably!
I can do this! I have to!
What's the big idea?!
Hee-hee! This is great!
All righty! Time to get moving!
You're not getting by! No waynot ever!
Great Daruk! There are a bunch of Guardians
coming from that bridge over there!
OK! I'll leave from here and greet our guests.
More Guardians! They're coming from the bridge
on the other side!
They're on that side now, eh? OK, Yunobo,
I'm heading that way!
Waaaah! I think that's a monster outpost...
There's a big building on the far side!
Maybe I overdid it... Sorry, ol' Rudania, ol' pal!
Argh! They're coming at us from everywhere
at once!
Bad! It's bad! They're targeting our defensive line!
Much more of this and they'll break through our
defensive line...
