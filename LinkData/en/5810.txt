Hurry! They must be stopped!
Even in a blizzard, there's no way they'd mistake
us for monsters. Why are they on the attack?
I hate to say it, but we need to take them out. We
can't allow any harm to befall the princess.
Be on alert for Guardian activity! We won't allow
them to harm our village any further!
This is no normal attack. Go and report this
to the village! We need updated orders!
We took out the bridge! Great! Now the village
should be safe.
So many arrows... Please, be careful!
Report! Guardian incursion to the southwest of
the village!
The Rito commander seems to be in the village.
We must parley with him before it's too late!
Link, could I ask you to head for the village?
I will remain by the princess's side.
A sketchy Hylian... That's unusual for
a raid. Hm.
He seems fairly stubborn, but no matter.
I'll have him turning tail in no time!
We can't allow those archers free rein. Please
dispose of them as soon as possible!
We must find a way to climb to the pinnacle.
There should be a road somewhere...
They seem to have split their forces in two. I bet
the commander's in the back... Let's destroy them!
Give up this futile incursion. Don't you have some
buddies to rescue?
Heh, sorry to make you go the long way. You'll
probably need to take a break soon.
Unless we do something, we'll be cornered!
There isn't a moment to lose...
Another rain of arrows? We can't allow this
to continue!
Defeat them and open the way!
This is certainly unusual for an assault. Our
strategies fell through. Now...it's up to me.
We're almost to Rito Village! Hopefully we can
find out what's going on here.
Our invaders have earned a special welcome...
a cornucopia of Rito arrows!
Our enemy is unlike any we've faced thus far!
This won't be easy... Stay on your guard!
Don't tell me... You can't even fly? Pfft!
This is hardly worth my time.
Aww, I'm starting to feel sort of sorry for these
pathetic creatures.
Recommend utilization of updrafts.
Attacks will be possible while in midair.
Heh, look at that. I didn't expect you to make it
this far. I suppose I'll go ahead and humor you.
Hmph. You're not as weak as expected. If I'm not
careful, you may even steal the win...
It's time to settle this nonsense. Don't blink,
or you'll miss my rousing victory!
This is serious. We must rush to their aid at once!
No! We're too late... I must get the princess to
safety at once.
Without Link's assistance, reaching the village
seems risky. We'd better retreat for now.
Ngh... Our efforts simply weren't enough.
Run, Princess. Please, run...
That rock... If we hit it hard enough, perhaps we
can break it.
They're attacking from above! Take heed!
Those rocks! It seems I'll have to take matters
into my own hands...
