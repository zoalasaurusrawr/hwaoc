You've lasted this long against me? Hm, I'm
mildly impressed.
I see how this could happen to the others...
but to ME?! Gah!
Pathetic. And here I thought I was going easy
on them...
Watch and learn!
Hate to disappoint, but you won't be
breaking through.
What?!
Satisfactory at best.
Time to let loose our superior strategy.
Incoming!
How unfortunate for you...to have to fight me.
This is a no-win situation. Time to fly.
I'm still not good enough... I'll have to retreat
for now.
I'm not the type to give up so easily.
The only possible resolution.
Bah! Absolutely pathetic. I'm mortified.
I am Revali, champion of the skies and hero of
the Rito!
Guh... Things are getting ugly.
Ungh... I could really use some help over here!
Well, I'm no Master Revali, but I can hold my own!
Time to clean up this mess.
Sorry, but this is as far as you go.
What?!
We have the momentum. Let's keep it up!
Come on, then! Let's carry out the plan.
On we go!
Think you can get past me? You're in for a
rude surprise.
I'm cooked. Sorry, everyoneyou'll have to go on
without me.
Looks like I have to retreat... With the shape I'm in,
I'd only hold you back.
Playtime is over. Now I'll show you what I'm really
made of.
Victory is ours. Let's bask in this triumph.
Looks like we've lost this one.
I am Teba, Rito warrior, protector of the skies.
I have dedicated myself to the art of the arrow.
Well done, Teba. A good reminder that I must
keep pushing myself.
Heh. That's what happens when you mess
with ME.
I can't believe this! I shouldn't have held back...
The only way to break the siege is to smash
through the outposts. Vah Medoh and I are on it.
All right, Vah Medoh. Let's show them what you're
made of.
That outpost is downright convenient. Let's warm
up, shall we?
OK! Let's keep going and squash any stragglers.
Look at those numbers. Let's send them flying
all at once.
A storehouse of bomb barrels... Talk about an
easy target.
We did some damage, but half are still left.
Even so, their siege is slowly crumbling...
It can fly, eh? No matter. A target is a target.
There's no time to attack them individually.
Let's take them out all at once!
Only one outpost left. Let's take it down quickly
and get to my triumphant return.
That's the price for messing with me and Vah
Medoh. I hope the failed knight saw my display...
Tch! I'll be a laughing stock...
Another flawless performance. I was destined to
pilot this Divine Beast!
Heh! That was a bit one-sided, don't you think?
We broke up the encirclement. Let's keep up
the momentum!
An ill wind stirs... Hopefully I'm imagining things.
All right! That thing must be finished now.
I am with you, Master Revali. Let's take down
outposts to stem the flow of enemies.
Our foes are advancing from east to west. Let's
head east first and cut off their support base.
On the other wing, we could move in from the
west and take them head-on.
Interesting. Our strategy hinges on which path we
choose. So...which will it be?
Huh. It looks like Vah Medoh's output is increasing.
I wonder...if it's because of you.
Not to overstate my importance, but...I'm glad my
presence here has done some good.
The monsters haven't gathered yet. Master Revali,
now's our chance!
True. We should be able to destroy the outposts
before the monsters get in our way.
Tch. Look at all the monsters that have gathered.
And more are incoming as we speak...
If we capture some outposts, we can slow down
their reinforcements.
We have to stop the invasion. Let's cut through
the valley and aim for the northeast outpost.
Might be wise to shoot down fliers as we go.
That ought to prevent an incursion to the west.
Curses. Look who's back.
Hmph. How unlucky for him that he appeared in
front of Vah Medoh. Should we ask him to leave?
Did we finish it off this time?
No... He gave us the slip again. He's an expert at
retreating, it seems.
The tundra is beyond this outpost. Let's take it
down in style.
Our enemies have dug in, it seems. If only there
was some way to take them all out at once...
The tundra is clear, but now we have some
monsters to take care of over there.
Their numbers are great, but no need to panic.
Let's thoroughly wipe out the enemy outposts.
Monsters are heading for the tundra as well.
We can't afford to get sloppy, Teba.
A few outposts here. Let's crush any enemies
we see.
The monsters' advance has stopped. Now, clear
out whoever's left in the plains and the tundra.
We've done quite a bit of destruction. Let's show
the same courtesy to the remaining outposts!
Oh, come on! How is it still coming for us?!
Some people never learn. Let's make them sorry
they ever laid eyes on us!
Master Revali, that was, well...masterful.
Yes... And you did well too, Teba. Picking a fight
with us? Heh! They got off easy.
Guh! This might be it for me...
I clearly...held back too much...
I can't wait to tell the folks back home about this.
Shame none of them will believe me...
You're from a hundred years in the future, right?
Is my training ground still maintained in the village?
Yes. All your admirers train at the Flight Range.
I take my son there often.
Incredible. Seems it was worth the effort to get it
built. Bet no one has matched my skill yet, though.
Even the wind itself is on our side. Now then...
Let's do this!
Understood!
They're advancing from the plains to the tundra.
Let's head east and cut them off from their base.
Alternatively...we could go through the tundra and
then move in to intercept them.
Our priority is to stop the monster incursion. We'll
cut across the valley and aim for that outpost.
Might be wise to shoot down fliers as we go.
That ought to prevent further incursions.
That's the last of them. Or it would be, except...
Gah, this is unforgivable. This glorious flight
is going down in flames...
My soaring days are over. Good luck to the rest
of you...
On the pride of the Rito, I vow to win this fight!
Well, well. If it isn't the coward from way back
when. I'm going to enjoy making you pay!
There were a fair few of them, yes. But against
you and me, they crumpled like paper.
Ha! I wouldn't have it any other way. Keep me
entertained just a bit longer!
They're persistent. But we must be nearing
the end of this... Right?
Onward, Vah Medoh! It's time to show them
what we're capable of.
Their numbers are irrelevant. They're simply
no match for us.
With me as Vah Medoh's pilot, victory is
practically guaranteed.
Teba has become quite adept with Vah Medoh.
Still... He'll have to work hard to keep up with me.
Our enemy is surprisingly competent. Maybe this
will actually be worth my effort.
Almost there! Time to make it rain, Vah Medoh!
Enemies are coming from the other side too.
So then...which side should we attack?
I'll have to give it my utmost, as usual. Vah Medoh,
come on! We're moving out!
To think that a full century before I met Link,
here he was. Like a force of nature.
He can pilot Vah Medoh as if its limbs are his own.
Incredible.
Vah Medoh, you trust me to pilot? I promise not to
let you down!
Hm, they're still coming at us in droves. This will
truly test our endurance!
Our wings will neither bend nor break! Isn't that
right, Vah Medoh?
The enemy is fighting more fiercely. But we will
not be stopped!
