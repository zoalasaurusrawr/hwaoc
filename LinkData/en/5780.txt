Shall we, Vah Ruta?
No matter the legions of foes standing before us,
we stride fearlessly forward.
Enemies coming from over that way! Vah Ruta,
lend me your power!
Hee-hee, you are raring to go. Goodso am I.
Vah Ruta is still responding to me... I must do my
best, even if it hurts.
My brother's eyes are on us. Vah Ruta, show him
what we can do!
May others find strength in our example. May we
restore peace to all Hyrule!
Just as I feared, the tide of battle is not in our
favor. But we must persist.
I am bent...but not broken. Even as my body
grows weak...I will stand strong!
Wonderful! I am glad to be doing my part.
Take heart. I am here to help.
This is our chance!
You shall advance no further. I will defend this
ground with my very life!
I don't believe it!
Hee-hee. We did it!
Time to carry out the plan!
Now, let us press forward!
Oh no you don't!
I am so sorry, my friends... I have failed you.
I am afraid my fight is over. Carry the torch
for me.
Everyone is counting on me! I cannot fail!
I am just glad I made it through in one piece.
I wish I could have done more.
I will be there as soon as I am able.
I am Mipha, princess of the Zora!
What a marvelous showing! I am proud to call you
my ally.
Incredible! I would hardly believe it, had I not been
here to witness the feat myself.
That was wonderful, Link. Just...take care not to
get hurt, all right?
Sweet Sidon. You are every bit the Zora I hoped
you would become.
Splendid work, Daruk! You swept those enemies
away with ease.
Revali, so graceful. There is poetry in the way
you wield your weapon.
Urbosa, the pride of the Gerudo. Your unrelenting
courage inspires us all.
What fine form! Your skill in battle is a marvel
to behold.
Simply amazing. Keep it up, and I have no doubt
we will triumph.
You are a wonder, Link! I will do all I can to live
up to the example you set.
Sidon, fearless protector of Hyrule. I am so proud
to see your growth.
Daruk, fantastic as always! I ought to take a
page out of your book.
You are unstoppable! Hehe, not that I expected
any less from the great Revali.
That was...phenomenal, Urbosa. I could hardly
look away.
You are rescuing me? Oh, thank you!
I cannot express my gratitude enough.
Thanks to you, I am still in this fight!
Link... Now that you are here, I know I can face
whatever comes my way.
I knew I could count on my little brother to help.
Thank you, Sidon.
I am glad to have you with me, Daruk.
Together, we will doubtless survive!
Revali, not a moment too soon! Let us bring an
end to this fighting, shall we?
Urbosa, you are here! What a relief it is to have
you by my side.
I beseech you, Vah Ruta, in our hour of need...
lend me your power!
There are so many monsters! Nevertheless,
together we can accomplish anything.
I see enemies at the top of that cliff. Time to
dispatch them!
There is an obstacle obstructing our path.
I wonder if I can topple it...
I see. The water grants Vah Ruta
improved mobility.
Gentle giant, your power is surging! That will
surely come to our advantage.
I have never seen so many Lynels. Still, we must
press on!
Thank you, Vah Ruta. Together, we have
restored peace to the domain.
Vah Ruta... We can keep everyone safe!
No! Vah Ruta... Without you, all hope is lost.
This is the magnitude of a Divine Beast's
power. Incredible.
Gentle giant... Our union, though new, feels age-old.
We stride forward as one!
There are only a few enemies left. We shall make
short work of them!
Quickly! There are enemies from above!
The way is blocked. But the obstacle will crumble
before your power.
Great though their numbers are, I know we
will triumph!
Prepared, Sidon? We shall carve a path to
Akkala Citadel!
Ah, the road forks here.
Vah Ruta's attacks are stronger. Sidon, you may
be augmenting the Divine Beast's power somehow.
Perhaps we chose the wrong path. There is no
time for the long way around, however.
Thank you for handling that, Vah Ruta. Now the
citadel is within sight... Oh!
Agreed. Come on, Sidon!
Link and the others should be headed for Akkala
Citadel too. We can all rendezvous there.
We must hurry, or we risk losing them!
Vah Ruta, no! I did not mean to push you so hard...
No... I meant to protect you all. I am sorry.
Hang in there, Vah Ruta. One more push!
Monsters everywhere. Without Vah Ruta, we could
not take one step forward.
Defeat is not an option. The very future of the
kingdom depends on us.
