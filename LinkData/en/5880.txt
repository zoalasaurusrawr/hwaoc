That's Link for you. His talent knows no bounds!
We're ready for the fight!
Well, I'm no Master Revali, but I can hold my own!
Time to clean up this mess.
We have the momentum. Let's keep it up!
Come on, then! Let's carry out the plan.
On we go!
Playtime is over. Now I'll show you what I'm really
made of.
Victory is ours. Let's bask in this triumph.
I am Teba, Rito warrior, protector of the skies.
I have dedicated myself to the art of the arrow.
