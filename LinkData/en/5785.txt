Guh... This could be a tough rock to swallow.
Me? Cornered? What are the odds...
Aw, yeah! Plenty more where that came from!
You can count on the fearless Daruk!
Time to roll out!
I've got this handled!
Hrm? What's this all about?
Hahaha! That'll teach you to mess with the
mighty Daruk!
Gotta use my brain muscle this time. Let's get
to it!
You can't stop this boulder from rollin'!
Hey! Stop right there!
Urgh... Sorry, but I've gotta take a breather.
This isn't good. Sorry, but you'll need to take it
from here.
Aw, yeaaah! Let's do this!
Hahaha! Score one for the Great Daruk!
You beat the Great Daruk?! I can't believe it...
Keep your heads on just a bit longer! Help's on
the way!
Daruk, the fearless Goron Champion...
Hey, that's me!
Argh! This hero stuff is hard!
Somebody! Anybody! Heeelp!
That's a job worthy of the Great Daruk...
Right, goro?
I can help! Probably!
I can do this! I have to!
Leave it to me!
What's the big idea?!
Hee-hee! This is great!
Let's, um...do that thing we talked about!
All righty! Time to get moving!
You're not getting by! No waynot ever!
Argh... Sorry, but I can't go on.
Please don't hate me...but I can't keep going.
Lord Daruk's blood runs through my veins! I can't
let him down!
I did it! Maybe I'm not so shabby after all, goro!
I wasn't good enough...
You need me? Really? OK! I'm on my way!
I am Yunobo, proud descendant of the great
Lord Daruk!
Great work! Knew I was right about you.
A Goron's gut is never wrong.
Oh yeaaaah! That takes care of that.
MORE monsters?! Persistent little beasties,
aren't they?
Nothin' to it! As long as I'm around, you'll never
mess with the Gorons.
Lookit that. The gang's all here! Let's combine our
forces and punch our way through!
Haha! I'm not called the Great Daruk for nothin'!
Oooh... You can do all that, eh? Let's give it
a whirl!
OK! I think I've got the hang of controlling this
Divine Beast now.
Some floaty guys too... Let's send 'em flyin' along
with the rest!
Haha, I'm really gettin' the hang of this.
In fact, I was born for it!
They're trying to punch through and head this
way. I'll base my attack on their movements!
A bunch more are heading our way. I'll be stuck
here forever if I pick 'em off one by one...
And that takes cares of that! I'm really gettin' the
hang of this!
Maybe I overdid it... Sorry, ol' Rudania, ol' pal!
Great view! The ridge looks...mmm, so tasty...
Seeing all those tasty rocks everywhere is makin'
my stomach rumble... After this, it's time to feast!
Nobody can stop Vah Rudania and the
Great Daruk!
A big group of 'em showed up. Heh, good thing
they're no match for ol' Rudania!
Gang up if ya wantit makes no difference.
You'll never get by me!
I'll let you know what the nearby enemies are
up to. You focus on fighting, Great Daruk!
Wowie! Such strength!
With you on board, our buddy here is workin' its
tail off. Makes it easy to wreck stuff up!
Yikes! The monsters are advancing!
Ugh... No matter how many we defeat, there's
always more.
If we stay on the defense, this'll go on forever.
Let's take out the bridges and stop 'em for good!
Great Daruk! Tons of Guardians are incoming
from the southern bridge!
Ready! Southern bridge, right? I'll head 'em off
from here!
Gah, Guardians every which way I turn! I can't
get close to the bridge like this...
MORE Guardians?! Yeesh! Now they're coming
from the northern bridge.
From the north this time, eh? OK, kid.
I'm on my way.
Are those all monster outposts?! Bah! Oh, um...
I can see a big building to the north!
OK, it's time. Now I can smash 'em to bits!
We managed to protect it! Thanks for helpin'
me out there, Yunobo!
Oh! Heheh...I...don't know how to react to such
high praise from the Great Daruk!
Haha, calm down, little fella. Now, let's keep it up
and send that Calamity Ganon creep packing.
Gah! I guess...that's it for me.
Noooo... I came to help everyone, but I didn't end
up being useful after all, goro...
The Great Daruk is huuuuge... He must eat A LOT.
You wanna grow big like me, kid? Just fill up on
tasty rocks every chance you get!
I'll do my best! I'll eat and eat until I can't eat
any more!
Heh, I've got some enemies to play with here,
too. Time to finish this!
Yeah! OK! I'll show you how strong I am, goro!
Great Daruk! There are a bunch of Guardians
coming from that bridge over there!
OK! I'll leave from here and greet our guests.
More Guardians! They're coming from the bridge
on the other side!
They're on that side now, eh? OK, Yunobo,
I'm heading that way!
Waaaah! I think that's a monster outpost...
There's a big building on the far side!
Bad! It's bad! They're targeting our defensive line!
Much more of this and they'll break through our
defensive line...
Raaargh! Don't get in my way!
We did it! We won!
OK! Let's get this party started!
Aww yeah! Let's show 'em how it's done,
Vah Rudania!
I've gotten pretty good at this, but we're still
not movin' as one... Yet!
Lookin' for seconds, are we? Ha ha ha!
My kinda foe!
That Yunobo's really gotten used to Vah Rudania.
The future of the Gorons sure is bright!
Argh. We're not doin' so hot...but that's not all
we've got. Right, Vah Rudania?
My turn! Let's do this, Vah Rudania!
No one can stop the Great Daruk and ol' Rudania!
Even me... I can make a difference, goro!
You really answered my call! Thank you,
Vah Rudania.
Let's go, Vah Rudania! We'll stop our enemy
no matter what!
The Great Daruk sure is great... Hee hee,
I'm really proud of my roots!
There's a lot of 'em, but we won't lose!
We're in this together!
The enemy's retreating! Let's chase 'em!
We did it! We really did it! Let's keep this up,
Vah Rudania. Um, if that's OK with you.
