Ngh... They know how to fight...
Gah! They have landed a few good blows...
They cannot withstand our strength!
Is escape our only recourse?
I must extricate my forces. I'm sorry.
The Gerudo losing to such a worthless opponent?
I think not!
We fought with all our strength and lost. Well met.
I feel secure knowing that you have my back.
Glad to see I am not the only one giving it my all.
Excellent. Even I could learn a thing or two from
that performance.
Glad to see I am not the only one giving it my all.
Splendid! You truly are fit to protect my little bird.
Battle suits you well, Princess. I am proud...yet the
feeling is tinged with sorrow.
Hahaha, well played, Riju! The future of the
Gerudo is in good hands.
Your style is unorthodoxbut your
results, irrefutable.
Perhaps I should stand back and let you take
the reins, eh, Mipha?
Well done, Daruk! You never miss a beat!
Not bad, Revali. And here I thought you were
all squawk.
