You're strong, but I refuse to back down!
Wahoo, Lady Impa! The aide with all the
fiercest moves!
They simply won't let up, will they?
This situation has gone from bad to worse.
I did it! Ahem... I mean, we've all done our part.
I have arrived. Now, where is our foe?
My time has come!
What is the meaning of this?!
How fortuitous!
It's time! Let's move out!
I must retreat... Yet the pain I feel is nothing
compared to this utter humiliation!
I refuse to fall here!
May this victory carve a path to a
better tomorrow!
I am Impa, royal advisor of Hyrule.
Argh! Somebody, help!
It's no use! We're goners, aren't we?!
Everyone...chaaarge!
Hold your positions!
No, no, no!
Good! Let's keep it up!
I'm sorry, but we must retreat!
Much more of this and we're done for.
We have to fall back and regroup!
We're not going down that easy!
That's a tough act to follow, but we'll do our best!
We're ready for the fight!
Gah, it's no use! We give up!
These foes are strong. Stay on your guard!
Everyone, hang in thereno matter what!
Gah! We can't hold out any longer!
Gah! It's too strong!
Oof, this is bad. If this keeps up, we're in trouble...
Shameful...
I doubt we can hold out much longer...
