HA=!
Our scouts located the critical facilities within the
hideout. We can topple the Yiga's entire operation.
It would be best to rendezvous with the hidden
scouts, but for now, let's continue our advance.
The Divine Beast completely razed the entrance.
Incredible.
Vah Naboris is powerful, yes. But now we have to
push forward without its help.
Hm. That trap is too dangerous. If only we could
find a way to disarm it.
Devious. How they managed to tame such
monsters, I do not know.
The Yiga Clan's stockpile.
Hands off our supplies, you dirty do-gooders!
The weapon cache has been captured! We must
keep up the pace.
That was quite a bang. Preparations are
complete, I take it.
We must rendezvous with the scout. Quickly,
head for the canals!
Lady Urbosa!
The enemy leader is in the square at the very
back... I don't know how to get there. I'm sorry.
No, you have done what you could. The path
will reveal itself.
The Yiga captured my friend and took her to
the dungeon. Please find her!
She let herself get ensnared in their web?
Sounds like a reckless one.
We had better break her out quickly. She may
have useful information.
The enemy's numbers have increased.
Keep moving, but stay on alert.
There's the guard! Wipe him out!
Tell me, what happened?
I discovered a secret door, but...as soon as I got
my hands on the key to it, they ambushed me.
A secret door? Sounds promisingwell done.
Now, to reclaim the key.
No luck. All these masked scoundrels look alike,
so we have no way to tell who holds the key.
Hmm. Where is a place that they would
willingly gather...
Wrong again, but no matter. I still have plenty of
fight in me.
You're free. Count yourself lucky, vai.
Thank you. Here is where to find the hidden door.
Now, we sever the head from the snake.
Storm in!
You go no further.
It seems they bested me. Well then, I haven't a
moment to lose in balancing the scales.
Phew... That was close. Now then, let's hurry.
Yiga cowards, you will pay for the suffering
you have caused!
You barged into MY napping spot, sans invite!
I have no choice but to destroy you!
*huff* *huff* What a *huff* dirty trick!
Keep fighting. Let us turn Kohga's napping spot
into his resting place.
Here I go! Banana...SPLIT!
Master Kohga, I am at your side.
Finally, you bum! What took you so long?!
Weakened though he is, that one may pose a
threat. Stay on guard.
Master Kohga... I am mortified...
No, no, no! Keep it together, Sooga!
Grr, I can't believe you wannabes humiliated me!
What will the rank-and-file Yiga think of me now?!
Submit, Kohga. It is over.
Oh no, it's not. I'm gonna dazzle you with my next
move, an ancient technique I call...RUNNING AWAY!
Link is unable to move.
Continuation of the battle plan is judged unviable.
No... A Gerudo warrior does not fail...
I'm so sorry... The fault is mine.
I'll be there soon. Try not to die in the meantime.
