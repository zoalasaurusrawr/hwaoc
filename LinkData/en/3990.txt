Oh, and ya can count on me to remove any
seals burned into weapons too. Easy!
Which seal do ya want removed?
Hey, once that seal is removed, it can't just be
undone! Ya sure ya want me to remove it?
One seal removal, just like ya asked!
Come back again if ya need somethin' else!
This one looks good as new now, huh?
Come back if ya want to attach some seals!
Hold on a second...
