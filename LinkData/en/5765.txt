Yipes! We have to protect this place, or those
jerks will destroy my precious ancient materials!
Urgh... You pulled me away from a perfectly good
nap for THIS?!
Quit whining and lend us a hand. They're coming
from over there!
*huff* Why didn't I just *huff* get one of my
*huff* lackeys to do this...
Sorry for dragging you along, Kohga. But hey,
feels good to get the blood pumping, doesn't it?!
So...tired... Must...lie down...
Thanks for the help! We'll take it from here.
Ow... I wanna go home... Can I go home?
