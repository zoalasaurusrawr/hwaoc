We're not going down that easy!
Argh! Stay strong! If we fall back, we're doomed...
We can't withstand much more of this. Quickly,
send help!
Everyone, hang in thereno matter what!
Gah! We can't hold out any longer!
Oof, this is bad. If this keeps up, we're in trouble...
Wow, thanks for your help!
But wait... If I aim for the moment it jumps up...
Seems worth trying, at least.
It's do or die!
I'll charge up power and blast it all at once!
That worked great, didn't it?
Let's keep going!
I bit off more than I could chew...
Maybe I can't call myself a pilot of the Divine Beast...
Yes, I'm sure you and I will get along nicely.
Now, how about we show them the will of the Gerudo!
You've given us a fair share of grief all up till now.
Today is the day the Gerudo thunder strikes you!
So the Guardians have gathered, have they...?
It looks like they see Naboris as a threat.
Guh... With this many enemies, I think even
Naboris might not get away scot-free...
I didn't think we could be delayed this much...!
If we get surrounded like this, it'll be the end. I have to get a grip!
We won't...make it in time now, will we...?
What're you talking about? I know from looking at you now...
that even the future Gerudo tribe lives on strong.
Naboris's name is derived from the name of an ancient sage...
It helps us fight the Calamity, just like the sage.
We've pretty much cleaned up here, haven't we!
Let's press the advantage!
All right, let's go, Naboris.
Let's scatter them to the wind.
The Princess herself is trying as best she can.
I too must do everything in my power to help.
That's a good pace, Naboris!
Let's keep this up moving on!
Riju, it seems Naboris is happy to be fighting alongside you!
How dare you keep springing up one after another...
Naboris and I shall take you all on!
Guh. They're still coming...?
Just hold on a little longer, Naboris.
OK, now it's my turn!
Time to show you the Gerudo spirit!
