Shall we, Vah Ruta?
No matter the legions of foes standing before us,
we stride fearlessly forward.
Enemies coming from over that way! Vah Ruta,
lend me your power!
Hee-hee, you are raring to go. Goodso am I.
Vah Ruta is still responding to me... I must do my
best, even if it hurts.
My brother's eyes are on us. Vah Ruta, show him
what we can do!
May others find strength in our example. May we
restore peace to all Hyrule!
Excellent show, Vah Ruta! I shall assist my sister
and Link.
You truly are the best, Link! As admirable as the
Link of my world, which is saying something!
If only saving my sister in this world would also
save the Mipha of my world. Alas...
Reinforcements, eh? Let us scatter them like
leaves on the ocean, Vah Ruta!
My dear sister was able to pilot Vah Ruta with
such ease... She is truly beyond compare!
Vah Ruta... Though I am not a Champion, you still
lent me your strength. I am honored and humbled.
Taking on both Vah Ruta and the Zora prince! Ha!
I commend your bravery, foolish though it may be.
Just as I feared, the tide of battle is not in our
favor. But we must persist.
I am bent...but not broken. Even as my body
grows weak...I will stand strong!
Wonderful! I am glad to be doing my part.
Take heart. I am here to help.
This is our chance!
You shall advance no further. I will defend this
ground with my very life!
I don't believe it!
Hee-hee. We did it!
Time to carry out the plan!
Now, let us press forward!
Oh no you don't!
I am so sorry, my friends... I have failed you.
I am afraid my fight is over. Carry the torch
for me.
Everyone is counting on me! I cannot fail!
I am just glad I made it through in one piece.
I wish I could have done more.
I will be there as soon as I am able.
I am Mipha, princess of the Zora!
What a marvelous showing! I am proud to call you
my ally.
Incredible! I would hardly believe it, had I not been
here to witness the feat myself.
That was wonderful, Link. Just...take care not to
get hurt, all right?
Sweet Sidon. You are every bit the Zora I hoped
you would become.
Splendid work, Daruk! You swept those enemies
away with ease.
Revali, so graceful. There is poetry in the way
you wield your weapon.
Urbosa, the pride of the Gerudo. Your unrelenting
courage inspires us all.
What fine form! Your skill in battle is a marvel
to behold.
Simply amazing. Keep it up, and I have no doubt
we will triumph.
You are a wonder, Link! I will do all I can to live
up to the example you set.
Sidon, fearless protector of Hyrule. I am so proud
to see your growth.
Daruk, fantastic as always! I ought to take a
page out of your book.
You are unstoppable! Hehe, not that I expected
any less from the great Revali.
That was...phenomenal, Urbosa. I could hardly
look away.
You are rescuing me? Oh, thank you!
I cannot express my gratitude enough.
Thanks to you, I am still in this fight!
Link... Now that you are here, I know I can face
whatever comes my way.
I knew I could count on my little brother to help.
Thank you, Sidon.
I am glad to have you with me, Daruk.
Together, we will doubtless survive!
Revali, not a moment too soon! Let us bring an
end to this fighting, shall we?
Urbosa, you are here! What a relief it is to have
you by my side.
Come on, then! See if you can get past me!
Link... I promise not to do any permanent harm.
Come on, Sidon! I want to witness your
strength firsthand!
Daruk! Strong as you are, I shan't lose!
Me against Revali? I don't like my chances,
but I'll try nonetheless!
I will not relish this, Urbosabut I will not
back down either!
Perhaps I need more training.
Your strength is astounding as ever, Link!
I have no shame in losing.
Well done, Sidon. I have never been so happy to
admit defeat.
You did not disappoint, Daruk. I had hoped to last
a little longer...
My loss. Perhaps someday I will rise to your
level, Revali.
Thank you for the thrilling bout, Urbosa!
These waters have become quite rough!
This is a tough spot, but I shall not fall short!
I have outdone myself! Exhilarating!
Apologies for the delay. Let us begin!
Let's give it our all. Follow me!
This is where your journey ends.
What's this?!
Ha! Such ecstasy!
The timing is ideal. Let us unleash you-know-what!
At last, we may proceed!
The only way through is to get past me.
Do your worst!
What a rotten turn of events... I fear I must away
for the moment.
It cannot be helped. I must retreat at once.
To flee would bring dishonor to the Zora.
I will not allow it!
Huzzah! Victory is ours!
Here? Now? Had I only trained harder...
I am on my way! Hold fast!
It is I, Sidon! Prince of the Zora!
Look at that! I consider this a challenge...
and your challenge has been accepted!
You're unstoppable! How invigorating!
Is there any era you can't succeed in, my friend?
I heartily doubt as much!
My sister is without equal! You never cease to
inspire me, Mipha.
Keep it up! I believe in you!
Victory shall soon prevail!
Link! You're amazing! Really and truly exceptional!
That's my sister! I strive to reach your heights
one day, Mipha.
My sincerest apologies and gratitude!
I'm sorry for the trouble. You arrived just in time!
There you are, dear friend! I look forward to
fighting at your side.
I came to save you, yet here you are saving me.
I am grateful, dear sister.
Apologies, but I shall not be holding back!
Let us duel, my friend! I relish the chance!
Sister! Perhaps you could train me in battle,
just like old times?
That is all? I did not think I would fall so easily...
I still cannot best you, my friend! Ah, but at
least it was fun.
The loss is mine. I still have much to learn
from you, dear sister!
