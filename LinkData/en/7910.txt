I must protect...everyone!
A tale of the Champions...
...a diminutive Guardian who traveled
backward through time...
...and the Great Calamity they faced.
Listen well, soldiers of Hyrule.
In our long history, we have scarcely faced a threat of this magnitude.
The years have passed quickly since Calamity Ganon's revival
was prophesied.
Yes, we have unearthed the Divine Beasts and filled volumes with
our knowledge of ancient relics.
But a barricade of books will not protect us.
Because this way surges a horde like we have never faced before.
Even now the enemy is clawing for our throatfor Hyrule Castle itself.
We must exterminate the monsters roaming Hyrule Field. Thus will begin
our renewed effort to stop the Calamity!
Here, now, go forth! 
And be brave for your kingdom!
You! Help!
Wh-whoa... Aah!
Huh? Why is this happening?!
It's...a tower?
Hmm...
An inexplicable Guardian...
...and a mysterious tower.
I hate to say it, but we have little hope of figuring this out on our own.
Hey, what are you...
No. Stop right there!
Each of you has served your kingdom admirably.
You made it! I'm glad you're safe, Impa.
Yes, Your Highness. And I've received the Sheikah Slate from Purah!
Ah... What is that?
Hm? Your Highness!
Oh...
Argh.
Grah! Ugh...
Why is it so...attached to me?
Whatever could you be, little one?
I suppose all we can do is wait for Robbie and the others at the lab
to analyze it.
Agreed, Your Highness.
Huh?!
A Guardian? But why?!
And monsters too. Now, of all times!
This is technology the likes of which I've never laid eyes on!
Which means...we've got ourselves a brand-new,
never-before-witnessed GUARDIAN MODEL!
Devices like the Sheikah Slate, which are amplified by the power of
such ancient relics, are but a meager fragment of such technology.
I see... That explains why all of us were able to use the Sheikah Slate.
In addition...
...this here doohickey is loaded with datainformation we can't
even fathom!
Aw, yeah! Check it!
I extracted some visual data from the Guardian's memory.
Is that...
Yup, no doubt about it. Hyrule Castle after Calamity Ganon has
been revived.
As you can see, we managed to extract some of the data, but much
of it was fragmented.
Even so, if I analyze what we received, I may be able to make sense
of more of it.
This is...the ruin the Calamity will bring upon all of Hyrule.
If we allow this to pass, I fear all hope will be lost.
Even everything we've done up until now...likely won't be enough...
If I don't succeed...at sealing the Calamity...
Never. This will not come to pass.
You intend to let this...relic follow you around, hm?
Yes.
After talking to Purah and Robbie, we thought it would be best.
I will remind you once again.
Above all else, your duty is of the utmost importance. Are we clear?
Yes, we are clear. I understand.
And I will honor my duty.
Mipha pilot the Divine Beast?
Yes.
My father, King Rhoam, has faith she will do her utmost...with
your permission, of course.
Hmm...
This will be a dangerous mission, piloting the Divine Beast against
the darkness.
And I understand that the knight who will seal that darkness has
not yet appeared.
That is true...
I must refuse. I cannot send my daughter into such peril.
But I
Your Majesty!
I bring news!
Well, Link. You've grown since I last saw you.
And yet...you have not changed.
This creature is a...Guardian?
How cute!
Princess Mipha!
Monsters on Ploymus Mountain! Marching this way!
What of my father?
His Majesty is leading the army to intercept.
He...thought the prince was here with you...
Sidon is missing?
We will find Sidon. You must watch over the domain.
Highness.
Sidon!
Why would you try to fight that beast alone?
I was so worried about you!
But still, I am proud.
What a brave little brother I have.
Oh no...
Mipha...
Huh?
What is that?
Zora! There is no turning back now!
King Dorephan!
Could it be?
This attack proves your point. We are woefully unprepared to defend
against the Calamity.
The Zora will face this peril head on. We must consider the future.
We all share this land of Hyrule, so all of us must do our part.
Mipha. Attend.
Yes, Father.
You will become the pilot of the Divine Beast Vah Ruta.
On one condition...
You must promise to come back safely.
What you'll learn about me is that I never refuse a sincere request.
So of course I'm on board with your plan!
Hmm... Except...there is one problem.
Well, it's just Vah Rudania is in a difficult spot right now.
The Divine Beast was found pretty high up on Death Mountain.
A lot of monsters have been crawling around lately, so even getting
close to ol' Rudania is a big pain.
Only the bravest go up there now...
So that's why it's a good thing it's gonna be us!
Oh, um, of course...
Come on! Death Mountain won't climb itself!
Oooh.
Seeing it again, it's even bigger than I remembered!
Let's get right to it, then.
Ooo, I can't wait!
That was unexpected, but we pulled through in the end.
You really proved yourself, eh, little guy?
Now, about me piloting Rudania...
Well, go ahead and count the mighty Daruk in!
Thank you, Daruk.
Of course! We'll smash that Calamity Ganon jerk to smithereens.
Ooh, wait a minute.
You must be starving after all that fighting.
I know just the cure for that.
My favorite...Prime Rock Roast!
Doesn't it look delicious? Why don'tcha dig in, little guy?
Oh! Uh...
Gah, sorry! How thoughtless of meI shoulda brought some for you,
tiny princess!
Next time, I promise to bring enough for everyone.
Th-thank you very much!
This nonsense again?
Rito Village is my home. While I'm here, you won't be getting any closer.
You may think you're good...
But I'm better!
Stop! Please!
Rito Village had repeatedly been attacked by
monsters led by an unusual Guardian.
Revali and his countrymen had barely repelled the
monsters but were wary of further attacks.
I understand the situation now.
I'm thankful no harm befell you. Either of you.
Pardon me...
But we must address the gravity of there being another
Guardian resembling the little one, Your Highness.
Yes...
If it is in some way connected to the Calamity, we must swiftly come
up with a strategy.
Out with it.
We both know you'll be needing my unique skills...to pilot that
Divine Beast. Hm?
However!
About this pathetic knight in your service...
Are you sure he's got what it takes?
What the
Oh, I see. Our friend believes itself to be a knight as well, in service of
the princess.
It whaaat?
Ugh. Ridiculous. Every last one of you.
But why? Why are the Gerudo attacking us?
Urbosa will surely be able to explain everything if we can reach her.
Urbosa!
Why? What are you doing?
Thwarting your destiny, of course...
Princess Zelda.
I came back as quickly as I could...
Not exactly what I expected to find.
Urbosa?
I hope you're not hurt...
...little bird.
I'm not!
You got some nerve if you think you can go toe-to-toe...with
MASTER KOHGA!
You've got some nerve thinking you can go toe to toe with...
MASTER KOHGA!
I'll show you...
I'll show YOU...
YIGA, ASSEMBLE! Me excluded of course.
Gah! How could these losers defeat me?!
Master Kohga.
Sooga, you're late! I nearly got peeled like a banana!
Forget these cowards. It's time to retreat.
I think not!
Hmph.
Thank you for meeting me here. The town is a bit...chaotic, shall we say.
Of course, Urbosa. We'd meet you anywhere.
You know about the...Yiga Clan, I trust?
Sheikah traitors working in the shadows to revive Calamity Ganon.
Those lowlifes have been wreaking havoc here in Gerudo Canyon.
How long can we stand by and watch them get away with it?
No longer, I say. I will pilot this Divine Beast.
You are precious to me, and you need my help. I cannot refuse.
Thank you, Urbosa.
As princess of Hyrule, I, too, will carry out my sworn duty.
Little bird...
However I am able to support you, I will. Just say the word.
So you turned and fled, is that it?
Hmm-hm Hm-hmm... Well, if they hadn't interrupted me...
It seems that, as low as my expectations of you were, I was
overly optimistic.
Well, no matter.
My harbinger...show me the future.
Ah... Yes...
The future as it will and must be. I will not allow anyone to alter
its course.
His Majesty did not offer even a single word of praise.
Well... It's only natural that Father would be frustrated.
But, Your Highness...
Right now, we must do whatever is in our power.
Please inform Mipha and Daruk that we depart tomorrow morning.
Then you plan to go to the Divine Beasts? Understood.
Oh my...
Father thinks that... He thinks that the reason my ability hasn't
awakened is because I haven't worked hard enough.
I imagine that when I visit the Divine Beasts, he'll say as much.
Link, you
The adjustments to the Divine Beasts are not yet complete.
We must fine-tune them for the individual pilots, to ensure that they
will be as effective as possible.
So many of their parts are complexwe don't yet understand them fully.
But I will discern their uses.
Daruk, I have a request.
Might I...join you for training next time?
I would like to be fully prepared. Learning new ways to fight foes
might do me some good.
Of course! The more, the merrier!
Thing is, we still need a knight gritty enough to seal the darkness,
and they're nowhere to be found.
Y-yes...
Although, hey! If ya see anybody that
What do they want?
Your Highness, I bring news. It regards your impending death.
Hmph.
I suppose destiny is at work, then.
The future is fickle.
Yiga Clan! Time to go.
Link...
Um...
Hyrule's king chose us to perform this pivotal task.
It will be my honor to excel, as always.
Then there's you, the one part that doesn't add up.
Why should this nobody be trusted to lead us in the coming battle?
It doesn't matter who's the leader. We're all in this together, right?
You are, of course, mistaken. My Divine Beast is the key!
Really, now... It makes no sense.
Well... My one comfort is that your reputation...will be completely ruined
once you fail. The fallen knight, heh heh!
Revali, how long do you expect us to put up with your prattle, huh?
I've said enough. The time has come to show you what I'm made of.
Now witness...Vah Medoh's divine power!
All clear over here!
OK, let's go!
And they're here.
This is quite the fog...
Are we even making progress? We could just be going in circles.
Good point. If only someone could fly above and scout the way.
As though I could see anything through this muck.
Honestly, do you ever think before you speak?
Getting lost is the least of our worries.
If something attacked us, we wouldn't see it coming.
Yes. We must be prepared for even the most unusual
Shaka!
Whee-hee-hee! Finally, finally, finally! Somebody sees me! Shakala-laka!
Huh? Where'd you come from?
And who...are you?
Oh, me? I am the one who brings song and dance to
Korok Forest! Hestu!
A Korok?
That's great! Mind guiding us through the fog, then?
Shoko...
I'd love to get home myself...
But there are scary, mean monsters in the woods, and I can't get
past them...
You could probably sneak right by if you didn't have those noisy maracas.
Oh, never mind him.
We have business in the forest. If you lead the way, we can handle
the monsters for you.
Oooh, really?! Woo-hoo! Yaaaaay!
In that case, follow! Follow!
Link!
Kill her.
What?!
Great Deku Tree.
All is well.
The sword you hold is the key to defeating the Calamityto sealing
the darkness.
Young hero, you have been chosen by the sword to wield its power
and vanquish the Calamity.
And you, Princess.
Do not lose hope. The path will open for you soon.
I see...
Forgive me. A deep slumber beckons, and even I cannot refuse.
You have all that is needed to face whatever destiny awaits.
Hyrule's fate...is in your hands...
How can I...
If I am unable to awaken my inner power...
That song...
Nighty-night.
I remember you.
Enemy ahead!
Link... He's become so much stronger.
"And yet, I have not." I presume that's what you're thinking, hm?
More and more monsters have been appearing lately. It is a sign that
the Calamity draws near.
So...there isn't much time.
And still, no sign of my power awakening...
Little bird...
Perhaps you are missing the point, comparing your progress to Link's.
He...is the same boy he was before acquiring that sword.
He will rise to...any challenge with no hesitation. That's all there is to it.
In that regard, you two are one and the same. Look how hard
you've worked to get this far.
Well, I... You see, I...
What did the Great Deku Tree say? There's no need to fret, Princess.
I know...that you are where you need to be.
You must accept that too.
Thank you, Urbosa.
We did it. We have all the pieces on the board to stop the Calamity.
With the knight who seals the darkness, the four Champions, and you,
of course, I'm positive we can turn back the
Would you stop making a nuisance of yourself? Unlike you,
the princess is extremely busy. Hey!
You cut it out. Now, listen you Stop that! We're trying to help
the princess here!
Come on, you two. There's no need to fight.
Urgh! How dare you act so disrespectfully in front of Her Highness,
you troublesome teapot?
So, Daruk... About what we discussed...
Ah, so you're ready to begin your training. Let's get to it!
Thank you. I hope to become stronger so that I can fight...alongside...
Oh! No, I-I was just, um... Ah...
Gah! Enough!
Leave me out of this! If you must fight, do it elsewhere!
Come back here, you whiny little...
Gah! Stop it!
How asinine.
Studying relics again, hm?
Father!
You think you have time to busy yourself with things like that?
It's just that I...
This is from a long time ago. It's a relic I found one day...while Mother
and I were out exploring.
Mother and I...we discussed it at some length together. It seemed special,
like it might hold hidden powers.
Even after all this time, I have yet to unravel its purpose.
But, Father, if you allow me to uncover the meaning behind such relics,
I believe it could help us to
Enough. That is not for you to determine.
It doesn't mean I won't continue with my training, Father!
But I also want... I want to...explore all optionsto do everything
that I can!
Even so, it seems that you are avoiding your duty.
I will allow it...for now. But do not forget your mission.
Hmm...
So if they can fix that Sheikah thingamajig, what does that mean for
meI mean, us?
That thingamajig will tell them where we are and what we're doing.
Our cover would be blown, huh? Sounds like bad news.
Measures are being taken. Soon you will each have your own parts
to play.
Respect, Sooga! This is a directive from Lord Ganon.
A-apologies!
This Guardian is possessed by Calamity Ganon, harbinger of destruction.
With it, I will bring this world to its knees.
You are blind, "seer."
Calamity Ganon...is not for mortals to control.
It wooorked!
Yes! You did wonderfully!
One down, and a whole lot more to go! Time's a-wasting, right?
What a magnificent view. We're so high up.
Purah, have you found anything yet?
I see, hmm... So by bonding this with the Sheikah Slate...
Hm, what's that? Purah?
Listen, Princess! These towers have got a lot of power hiding inside!
The Sheikah Towers were designed to scan their surroundings for
Calamity Ganon.
When we activate them, the terminals load the Sheikah Slate with
a map of the area!
You can see the geography nearbyand locate monstersas easy
as click, snap!
So, we can track down the enemy and take them by surprise.
Preeecisely!
Whoa, whoa!
Rather than just telling you about it, why don't I give you a little demo?
Well, it's time. You and I must now ride into battle without the luxury
of training.
Then again...
Experience is the best teacher.
Upsy-daisy...
Look what you did!
Well! I don't mind. I don't mind one itsy-bitsy bit.
And do you know why, hm?
Because your thread's about to get cut, and I'm the shears. SNIP! SNIP!
What a relief it will be when you meddlers are out of the picture!
Yes!
Today! Right now, in fact!
The stupendous chief of the Yiga Clan, MASTER KOHGA...
...is gonna KILL YOU ALL...TO DEATH!
Hmph...
Hey, prophecy man! You missed the part where we get walloped!
I am afraid we cannot overlook this failure, seer.
Can't do it!
Hm. Fate decides all...even this defeat.
As you well know, if you decided to turn against me...
...you would make an enemy of Calamity Ganon.
So you see, then.
Good. We will need each other's help if we are to achieve our
grand purpose.
In the name of Calamity Ganon, you and I are bound. Let us turn our
eyes to the task before us, yes?
These Sheikah Towers... They are rather useful, I admit.
I know, right?!
Oh, but just wait! There's one more thing I gotta show ya!
Purah! A little warning would have been nice.
Sorry, sorry. 
But look! Is this technology amazing or what?
Right now we can't teleport many people at onceand anyhoo,
there aren't many places we can travel.
But with further study, I think these towers will be invaluable!
Lucky for us, I have lots of new researchers on my team too.
It won't be easy, but we're not gonna let that stop us, eh?
I know that you won't.
I wish I could join you, but now...
Ah... Anyway, I'm glad for your help, Purah.
Are you certain of this?
Yes.
Zelda's next birthday...will mark the date of Calamity Ganon's return.
Yes. That is what the images we recovered indicate, at least.
Time has run out, then.
Zelda.
You and the knights will travel to the Spring of Courage.
No matter what it takes, you must awaken your power before the
Calamity returns.
Understood.
I will do whatever I can, as I am right now.
Even if all I have to give is my faith that things will work out.
This is the thread that I have been following all this time.
Even so...
All of the research into the relicsif I cannot awaken to my powerwill
have been in vain.
Everyone else...is carrying out their duties with such grace.
I am the only one...who cannot live up...to her own potential...
Princess Zelda...
Why not... Let's go take a break somewhere! I've gotten really...
Uh... Suddenly I'm really hungry!
Impa...
There's just...no more time.
Is...everyone all right? Ah, thank goodness.
We're all right because of you, Princess. Your keen senses saved us!
Well, I... Really, it was thanks to your strength.
Now, you listen to me!
O-OK...
You said that...you are the only one who can't live up to your potential.
But that's completely untrue!
I mean, you saved all of us just now!
All of your effortyour researchis not in vain, Princess!
Thank you, Impa.
I want...
I will fight...to fulfill my duty, until the very end.
That's really...all I can do.
Excellent, I've finally finished my painstaking analysis. Oh yeaaah!
Yeah, yeah, we're all very impressed. Now, what did you find?
Do you see...
Stop right there.
I was too careless. This is bad.
Stop that thing!
So many are awaiting my inner powerbelieving in me.
This is my last chance.
Princess, it'll all work out.
Everything will just...align at the Spring of Wisdom.
Time to head out.
Farewell, Father...
Huh!
H-hey!
The Sheikah Slate?
Something must have happened.
It cannot be!
All righty
