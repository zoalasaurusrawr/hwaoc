I will not stand down. I will not cede this place!
Never will you pass beyond here!
No matter the outcome, I will not back down!
Ugh... Things are dire... Someone, lend us aid!
Let's begin.
I'll stand my ground, no matter the cost.
Everyone, that was incredible! We succeeded!
Here? Like this? But...I have to pull through...
We didn't make it in time... I'm so sorry...
We won't be able to hold out like this!
To fall here? To fall so short...
The only way we will win is if we fight together.
Each of you must lend your unique strength!
Father! To fight by your sidethere is no
greater honor.
We need not fear. We will not lose.
You have no claim to this place!
As long as this heart thrums in my chest,
I will not let you through!
This will truly test our mettle.
Very well, then. I shall face you myself!
Zelda, always protecting others. Allow me to
protect you now.
You... I will sever your thread, once and for all!
The story of my triumph was writ long ago!
How dare you try to efface it!
I am Calamity Ganon's right hand! An emissary of
fate itself! I cannot be beaten!
Hurrah! Let's have a little cheer!
Yes... This is exactly the outcome I envisioned!
Yes. Exactly as it should be.
It's time, Calamity Ganon! Time to settle this once
and for all!
The enemy approaches! Be on your
guard, everyone!
Bet you're surprised that I'm the guy savin'
your peels!
Now, minions, let us carry out...the PLAN.
Hold it right there! You step on Master Kohga's
turf, you'd better be ready to throw down!
In a bit of a pickle, eh? OK, OK, no need to tell
me twice. I'm on my way.
Here I come.
You'll not go any farther than this.
Your road ends here.
I will arrive imminently.
Right, then. We'll head for the front!
Now's our chance! Everybody, get in position!
Help is on the way! Just remember you owe
us some mighty bananas when this is over.
Thank you for the assistance. Victory is within
our grasp now!
Attacking from the watchtowers? How irritating.
Now, they die.
Is that...a Molduga?!
It must have been drawn to all the noise.
Best not to linger.
Well done, Naboris! For my part, I am finally
getting used to these controls.
Hmm. Electrical attacks may prove ineffective.
It seems we cannot land a hit when the creature
is beneath the sand.
Perhaps if we strike at the exact moment it
breaches the surface...
Now is the time. Charge up, and then let loose!
That did the trick! Now, let us press on!
Good! With that done, we can push forward to
their hideout.
I...failed. Perhaps I was not a worthy Divine Beast
pilot after all.
We cannot afford to waste more time, or the
Yiga Clan rats will escape!
Blazes! Most of them slipped through our fingers.
Quite a pair we make. Now, to show them the will
of the Gerudo!
You have stirred up a tempest, now suffer the
lightning!
We should be near the hideout now. Prepare to
fight for your lives, Yiga!
A pack of Guardians against two Gerudo vai?
I like our chances. Come on!
Yes, Lady Urbosa!
Weak though I am, I'll humbly offer my help too!
Lady Urbosa, it's terrible!
A squad of Guardians heading in the direction of Fort Hateno has...!
No. They must not be allowed to spread beyond
Hyrule Field.
Come on! These contraptions will not let up,
so neither can we!
Right!
Let's do all we can to stop them here!
That is most of the ones headed for Fort Hateno,
dealt with. You are a powerful ally, Riju!
I... My lowly self is nothing compared to you, Lady Urbosa!
...Nay, I will continue to strive to match you!
As the one who will succeed you as the Chief of our tribe!
The Guardians are swarming. It seems they
recognize Naboris as a threat.
Oh no... There are more Guardians than I can count...
Are all of them really taking aim at us...?
You are far from alone, remember. Persist and a
path will open.
Lady Urbosa, how spectacular!
Brilliant, Riju! One last push!
We did it... We really did it!
Yes. Marvelously done, Riju. You showed true
courage today.
! ...Mm, that's because you were here, Lady Urbosa.
Come on, let's deal with the remaining Guardians!
Guh... With enemies in these numbers, even Naboris
may not survive unscathed.
I will support you till the last as well.
Let us get to it, Lady Urbosa...!
At last, even the Naboris is at her limit...
After all that, I was...
Nowe have not lost yet. Take my hand.
Keep your gaze on the present moment.
I am sorry, Riju. I let you down. I let myself down.
Oh no...
Naboris... Lady Urbosa...
We cannot afford to get bogged down. Too much
is at stake!
We don't have too much time left...
We have to defeat more Guardians, even if just a little!
Guardians in every direction...
L-Lady Urbosa...
Courage, Riju... I will keep you alive, no matter
what it costs me.
No! I fear we are too late.
Ever since I threw myself into this conflict, I've been
constantly made aware of my inexperience time after time...
Nonsense! I have never felt more certain that the
Gerudo will thrive after I am gone.
I remembered a story I heard from my mother a long time ago.
She said Naboris was a guardian deity of the Gerudo...
An ancient sage who fought to protect us from
Calamity Ganon, just as Naboris does now.
We seem to have cleaned up here. Now, we press
our advantage!
Yes, Lady Urbosa!
Go forth, Naboris. We will tear them to shreds.
The princess is giving all she has. I owe it to her
to do the same.
Moving at a good clip, Naboris. Keep it up!
Riju, it seems Naboris has taken a shine to you.
You dare stand against us? Naboris and I will
punish your arrogance!
Guh. They are not letting up. Be strong, Naboris.
My turn. Now, witness the spirit of the Gerudo!
Naboris, if you will.
Please lend me your strength.
Be it past or future, I as Chief will be the one to protect the Gerudo!
So that's the Link of 100 years past.
What truly incredible bravery...
I never thought the day would come where I'd fight shoulder to shoulder with Lady Urbosa...
Here we go, Naboris!
Crush the enemy with that lightning!
Ngh, is Naboris all right...?
Just a little longer. Hold out for me!
No enemy can stand before the Gerudo.
Not while Naboris is with us!
