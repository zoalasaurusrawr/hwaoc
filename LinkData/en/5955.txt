I will end you myself, you nuisance!
They have defeated the Hollows, hm? No matter.
I will simply raise more.
A valiant effort! But not enough, you'll find.
This was over long before it began.
I am bent...but not broken. Even as my body
grows weak...I will stand strong!
Wonderful! I am glad to have done my part.
Take heart. I am here to help.
This is our chance!
You shall advance no further. I will defend this
position with my very life!
No! I don't believe it!
Hee-hee. We did it!
Time to carry out the plan!
Now, let us press forward!
Oh no you don't!
I am so sorry, my friends... I have failed you.
I am afraid my fight is over. Carry the torch
for me.
Everyone is counting on me! I cannot fail!
How wonderful! We made it through!
I wish I could have done more to help.
I will be there as soon as I am able.
I am Mipha, Princess of the Zora!
