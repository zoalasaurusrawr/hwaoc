Enemies! Even within the citadel! Everyone, we
must hurry!
If we end up losing soldiers, then what's the point
of us coming here?
Look at all those Guardians across the bridge!
What can we do?
Sister! Leave the northern Guardians to me.
You and the others head for the citadel.
Guardians in front of the citadel. Let's join forces
and break through!
All right, inside! Quickly!
Oof, this is bad. If this keeps up, we're in trouble...
Our allies are fighting for their lives. We must
rush to their aid.
Are you badly hurt? Here, I can heal you.
Whoa! My wounds are closing up just like that!
Lady Mipha's healing power is amazing...
You've saved us. Thank you! I can only hope our
friends are unharmed...
I wish we could be of use to you... Oh, I know!
We'll move the rubble for you!
Report! The southern gate has been infiltrated!
I am not loving those numbers... I shall hold down
the reinforcements! The remaining foes are yours!
Everyone, please protect the citadel entrance!
I will venture further in and do what I can.
Understood. Please leave this in our hands!
Mipha, with your healing power, you should be
able to save everyone. I leave this to you.
Fear not. I can heal you.
Th-thank you very much! I'll move to defend the
square as well!
You will soon be well again. Hold still.
I swear, I will never forget this kindness!
I'll go and reinforce the square at once!
Come to think of it... Master Robbie was on a
higher floor. I hope he's still OK.
Thank you for protecting the citadel. Here, I can
mend you.
Thank you, Lady Mipha! I will turn to defending
the square.
Phew... All the soldiers are back on their feet.
Now to find Robbie.
Robbie, are you in there? I am here to help!
Oh! Mipha? Mipha! I'll open the doorhang on!
Oho, you've come to save me?! Hang onopening
the door!
So you are not wounded! Good.
Whew, you really saved my day! Although...I feel
something coming from nearby...
A Guardian?!
No! How did it get in here?! Robbie, stand back!
Somehow they seem even more sinister than
before. Regardless, we cannot back down!
It's awful! Even more enemies are closing in
on us!
We won't be able to hold out like this!
Sorry for the delay, folks. But we're here now
and ready to roll!
Raaargh! Don't get in my way!
I've got this place covered, Princess. You go and
help out Mipha!
Leave this place to me. You've gotta go and
help Mipha!
Mipha! I'm so glad I made it... Let's join together
and strike them down!
Princess, you came! Now we can fight them side
by side!
A belated arrival, Linkbut a welcome one. 
Now make yourself useful, would you?
They are defeated. It should be safe now, Robbie.
Oho! You saved my skin! Thank you very much!
Look at that. Mipha did great! Now all I gotta do
is take out the remaining enemies.
Enemy reinforcements...again? And to top it off,
Guardians... A lot of them...
Huff... Huff... Who knew piloting a Divine Beast
would be such a workout!
Sidon, are you all right?! We may not be able to
rely on Vah Ruta anymore...
We can't place all our hopes on the Divine Beast.
We'll go and intercept!
Right. If you draw the enemies to the bridge, we'll
destroy enemies on it with the citadel's cannons!
All right! Time to squash the brutes on the bridge!
Very well. I will combat their forces to the south.
Yikes! Enemies are making it over the bridge!
Hurry and stop them!
Sorry for the wait! Preparations are complete.
Fire the cannons at will!
All clear in the south!
It's dangerous for you to hang out there! Quickly,
return to the citadel!
Looks like we got them in our sights! And...FIRE!
The results are astounding! They are mere fish
food now!
Time to strike down the remaining enemies. Let's
glide down from the cliff into the exercise yard!
With this, we were able to defeat all the enemies.
I'm so glad we succeeded in defending the citadel.
Commendable, Sidon! You deserve our thanks.
As does Vah Ruta, of course.
No, Sister. The glory is yours alone, as expected.
Without you, those soldiers would have perished.
Thanks to everyone's hard work and the Divine
Beast, we were saved! Thank you! Thank you!
To fall here? To fall so short...
Even with Sidon's aid, I could not outrun my fate...
My fuse has fizzled... Ugh...
Link?! But we cannot lose you!
Shameful...
Is this...the end?
Wait! I... I couldn't help...
Across the bridgelook how many there are!
How can we deal with them all?
Leave them to me. You hurry to the citadel!
I doubt we can hold out much longer...
I refuse to abandon them. We will aid them.
Hold on. I will treat your injuries.
Oh! My body's knitting itself back together!
Thank you! And please, if you could help my
fellow soldiers in the citadel...
Enemies here too. Let us band together and
break through!
What a reliefwe can move freely! We'll clear
away that rubble for you.
Aah! I mean, uh...report! More enemies breaching
the citadel!
So many... I shall hold back the reinforcements!
You handle the remaining enemies!
Th-thank you! I'll try to fend off enemies
advancing from the south.
Th-thank you! I'll try to shore up our defenses.
Thanks, I owe you one! Now I can head to the
citadel's southern defensive line!
Thanks, I owe you one! Now I can join in the
fight against incoming enemies!
Ah, of course! Doctor Robbie is still in there!
I hope he's OK...
We are in your debt, Princess. Allow us to help
the defensive line.
More enemy reinforcements? And such powerful
enemies within their ranks...
Okeydokey. You lure the enemies in, then we'll use
the cannons to take them all out in one KABOOM!
Great! In that case, I'll hold off the enemies
for ya.
Very good. I can engage the remaining enemies.
All right! That is all of them dealt with!
The cannons are just about ready to fire!
Everyone, fall back to the citadel!
Time to take down the remaining enemies!
I can't believe this. I came to help, but I went
and lost the battle...
