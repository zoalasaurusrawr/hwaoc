Everyone...chaaarge!
No, no, no!
I'm sorry, but we must retreat!
We're not going down that easy!
That's Link for you. His talent knows no bounds!
Whoa. We knew you were good, but we didn't
know you were THAT good.
We're ready for the fight!
Gah! It's too strong!
They simply won't let up, will they?
This situation has gone from bad to worse.
I have arrived. Now, where is our foe?
My time has come!
You're strong, but I refuse to back down!
You're incredible, Link! But next time,
victory is mine.
Me? Cornered? What are the odds...
Daruk, the fearless Goron Champion...
Hey, that's me!
You there! Let's rumble.
