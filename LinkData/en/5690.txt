This trial that Lady Urbosa bestowed upon us...
We must see it through at all costs.
Those of the Yiga Clan, who disturb the peace of
our desert... I, chief of the Gerudo, will stop you!
You will go no farther. Further violence will not
be tolerated.
Disgraceful...
We must not overstay our welcome... Everyone,
we will make our swift retreat.
Good. Those Yiga traitors should stay put,
at least for now.
I must report back to Lady Urbosa at once.
Perhaps I have new strength to share...
I will banish you from this plane of existence.
