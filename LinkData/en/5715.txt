Such flair! Master Revali is in a class of his own!
I've been aching to settle the score with you.
Prepare to witness the wonder of Revali!
You've lasted this long against me? Hm, I'm
mildly impressed.
I see how this could happen to the others...
but to ME?! Gah!
Pathetic. And here I thought I was going easy
on them...
Watch and learn!
Hate to disappoint, but you won't be
breaking through.
What?!
Satisfactory at best.
You think you stand a chance against me? Ha!
Allow me to bring you back to reality.
Our invaders have earned a special welcome...
a cornucopia of Rito arrows!
Aww, I'm starting to feel sort of sorry for these
pathetic creatures.
Heh. That's what happens when you mess
with ME.
OK! Let's keep going and squash any stragglers.
Look at those numbers. Let's send them flying
all at once.
An ill wind stirs... Hopefully I'm imagining things.
Some people never learn. Let's make them sorry
they ever laid eyes on us!
Even the wind itself is on our side. Now then...
Let's do this!
Ha! I wouldn't have it any other way. Keep me
entertained just a bit longer!
They're persistent. But we must be nearing
the end of this... Right?
Our enemy is surprisingly competent. Maybe this
will actually be worth my effort.
Time to let loose our superior strategy.
How unfortunate for you...to have to fight me.
It's time to settle this nonsense. Don't blink,
or you'll miss my rousing victory!
